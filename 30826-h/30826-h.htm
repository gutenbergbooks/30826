<h2><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>OH, SUSANNAH!</span></h2>

<p>Somewhere in this book I must write a paragraph exclusively about myself. The
fact that in the outcome of all these stirring events I have ended as a mere
bookkeeper is perhaps a good reason why one paragraph will be enough. In my
youth I had dreams a-plenty; but the event and the peculiar twist of my own
temperament prevented their fulfilment. Perhaps in a more squeamish
age&#8211;and yet that is not fair, either, to the men whose destinies I am
trying to record. Suffice it then that of these men I have been the friend and
companion, of these occasions I have been a part, and that the very lacks and
reservations of my own character that have kept me to a subordinate position and
a little garden have probably made me the better spectator. Which is a longer
paragraph about myself than I had purposed writing.</p>

<p>Therefore I will pass over briefly the various reasons, romantic and
practical, why I decided to join the gold rush to California in the year 1849.
It was in the air; and I was then of a romantic and adventurous disposition.</p>

<p>The first news of the gold discovery filtered to us in a roundabout way
through vessels to the Sandwich Islands, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_4'></a>4</span> and then appeared again in the columns of some
Baltimore paper. Everybody laughed at the rumour; but everybody remembered it.
The land was infinitely remote; and then, as now, romance increases as the
square of the distance. There might well be gold there; but more authentic were
the reports of fleas, rawhides, and a dried-up coast. Minstrel shows made a good
deal of fun of it all, I remember. Then, when we were of a broad grin, came the
publication of the letter written by Governor Mason to the War Department. That
was a sober official document, and had to be believed, but it read like a fairy
tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no hesitation in saying,&#8221; wrote the governor, &#8220;that
there is more gold in the country drained by the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers than would pay the costs of the late war with Mexico a hundred times
over.&#8221; And he then went on to report in detail big nuggets and big
washings, mentioning men, places, dates, in a circumstantial manner that carried
conviction.</p>

<p>Our broad grins faded. The minstrels&#8217; jokes changed colour. As I look
back, it seems to me that I can almost see with the physical eye the broad
restless upheaval beneath the surface of all society. The Mexican war was just
over, and the veterans&#8211;young veterans all&#8211;filled with the spirit of
adventure turned eagerly toward this glittering new emprise. Out in the small
villages, on the small farms, the news was talked over seriously, almost without
excitement, as offering a possible means of lifting the burden war had laid.
Families strained their resources, mortgaged their possessions, to equip and
send their single strongest members to make the common fortune.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>Then came the song
that caught the popular ear; and the rush was on. Most great movements are done
to song, generally commonplace. It was so in this instance. <i>Oh, Susannah!</i>
or rather a modification of the original made to fit the occasion, first sung in
some minstrel show, ran like fire in the tinder of men&#8217;s excited hopes.
From every stage, on every street corner, in every restaurant and hotel it was
sung, played, and whistled. At the sound of its first notes the audience always
sprang to its feet and cheered like mad.</p>

<p>The desire to go to El Dorado was universal, and almost irresistible. The
ability to go was much more circumscribed. For one thing, it cost a good deal of
money; and that was where <i>I</i> bogged down at the first pull. Then I suppose
a majority did have ties of family, business or other responsibilities
impossible to shake off. However, we all joined one or more of the various clubs
formed for the purpose of getting at least some of their members to California;
and discussed heatedly the merits of the different routes; and went into minute
and fascinating details as to processes of which we knew less than nothing; and
sang <i>Oh, Susannah</i>! and talked ourselves into a glorified fever of
excitement; and went home with our heads in the clouds. Once in a great while
some of these clubs came to something&#8211;as a body I mean; for individual
members were constantly working themselves up the summit of resolution to rush
headlong and regardless down the other side and out of our sight. When a man had
reached a certain pitch of excitement he ran amuck. He sold anything, deserted
anything, broke through anything in the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_6'></a>6</span> way of family, responsibility, or financial lacks in
order to go. But, as I say, occasionally one of these clubs pooled its
individual resources and bought some old tub of a whaler, or outfitted a wagon
train, and started off. But generally we got only as far as <i>Oh, Susannah!</i>
I remember once, in coming out from one of our meetings, finding myself next a
solemn and earnest youth originally from my own rural village. He walked by my
side for several squares lost in a brown study. Then suddenly he looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frank,&#8221; said he with conviction, &#8220;I believe I&#8217;ll go.
I know most of this talk is wildly exaggerated, but I&#8217;m sensible enough to
discount all that sort of thing and to disbelieve absurd stories. I shan&#8217;t
go with the slightest notion of finding the thing true, but will be satisfied if
I do reasonably well. In fact, if I don&#8217;t pick up more than a hatful of
gold a day, I shall be perfectly satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which remark sufficiently indicates about where we all were!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE HAMMERLOCK</span></h2>

<p>We had many sorts of men in our club, but nearly all young. One, in especial,
early attracted my attention, and held it through all the changing vicissitudes
of our many meetings. I say attracted me, though fascinated would be perhaps the
better word, for after the first evening of his attendance I used deliberately
so to place myself that I could watch him.</p>

<p>He came always in a rather worn military cape, which on entering the door he
promptly threw back in such a manner as to display the red lining. This seemed
an appropriate envelopment of his flaming, buoyant personality. He walked with
his chin up and his back straight, and trod directly on and over the ends of his
toes so that he seemed fairly to spring with vigour. His body was very erect and
tall and pliant, bending easily to every change of balance. If I were never to
have seen his face at all I should have placed him as one of the laughing
spirits of the world. His head was rather small, round, well poised, with soft
close-set ringlets all over it like a cap, in the fashion of some marble gods I
have seen. He had very regular, handsome features, with a clear, biscuit-brown
complexion, and a close-clipped, stubby, light moustache. All these things were
interesting and attractive, though no more so than are the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span> vigour and beauty of any perfect animal.
But the quality of his eyes placed him, at least to me, in a class apart. They
were sober, clear eyes, that looked out gray and contemplative on the world
about them; so that one got the instant impression of a soul behind them that
weighed and judged. Indeed they were not laughing eyes at all, and rather
negatived the impression made by the man&#8217;s general bearing. But somewhere
down in them something flickered like a strong burning candle in a brisk wind.
Occasionally it was almost out; then again it blazed up clear, so that one
thought to see it plainly through the steady brooding look. It always fascinated
the beholder, for it was mysterious. Whether it came and went, grew and shrank,
following delicately the moods or reflections of the spirit within, or whether
it was a purely fortuitous effect of light and refraction, no man was ever able
to say. And some men later made some very bad guesses. I myself think it was the
devil of genius&#8211;a devil behind the steady control of a clear brain. His
name, I soon discovered, was Talbot Ward.</p>

<p>At this period I was starting in as an assistant bookkeeper to a large
exporting firm. They were enterprising people, and already they were laying
plans to capture some of the California trade. The office talk I heard
concerning the purchase of ships, the consignment of arms, the engagement of
captains and of crews further inflamed my imagination. I received the vast sum
of nine dollars per week. As I was quite alone in the world, and possessed no
other resources, the saving of the five hundred dollars agreed upon as the least
sum with which it was possible to get to California was fairly out of all
question.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>One evening, after
the meeting, to my great surprise, Ward fell into step with me. We had up to
that moment never exchanged a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;In New York long?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;About six months,&#8221; I told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farm bred, of course?&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashbury in Vermont,&#8221; I replied, without the slightest feeling
that he was intrusive.</p>

<p>He stopped short in the street and looked me up and down reflectively, but
without comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been watching you at these fool meetings,&#8221; said he,
falling into step again.</p>

<p>In spite of myself I experienced a glow of gratification at having been the
object of his interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool meetings?&#8221; I echoed inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose, by a miracle, all that lot could agree, and could start for
California to-morrow, in a body&#8211;that&#8217;s what they are organized for,
I believe,&#8221; he countered&#8211;&#8220;would you go with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Martin is why not; and Fowler is why not; and that little Smith runt,
and six or eight others. They are weak sisters. If you are going into a thing,
go into it with the strong men. I wouldn&#8217;t go with that crowd to a snake
fight if it was twelve miles away. Where do you live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;West Ninth Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not far. Have you a good big room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a very small hall bedroom,&#8221; I replied wonderingly;
&#8220;a number of us have the whole of the top floor.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>Somehow, I must
repeat, this unexplained intrusion of a total stranger into my private affairs
did not offend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must have a big sitting-room. How many of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you lick all the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped to laugh. By some shrewd guess he had hit on our chief difficulty
as a community. We were all four country boys with a good deal of residuary
energy and high spirits; and we were not popular with the tenants
underneath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I&#8217;m pretty big&#x2500;&#8221; I reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see you are. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m with you. Do you think
you can lick me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stopped short again, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in blazes&#x2500;&#8221; I began.</p>

<p>He laughed, and the devils in his eyes danced right out to the surface of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked you a plain question,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;d
like the favour of a plain answer. Do you think you can lick me as well as your
rural friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; said I shortly.</p>

<p>He ran his arm through mine eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;on to West Ninth!&#8221;</p>

<p>We found two of my roommates smoking and talking before the tiny open fire.
Talbot Ward, full of the business in hand, rushed directly at the matter once
the introductions were over.</p>

<p>Our arrangements were very simple; the chairs were few and pushed back
easily, and we had an old set of gloves.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>&#8220;Which is it
to be?&#8221; I asked my guest, &#8220;boxing or wrestling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said you couldn&#8217;t <i>lick</i> me,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Boxing is a game with rules; it isn&#8217;t fighting at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to bite and gouge and scratch, then?&#8221; said I, greatly
amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not; they would not be fair; a fight&#8217;s a fight; but a man
can be decent with it all. We&#8217;ll put on the gloves, and we&#8217;ll hit
and wrestle both&#8211;in fact, we&#8217;ll fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began rapidly to strip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you expect to get off your clothes in a real fight?&#8221; I
asked him a little sardonically.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I <i>expected</i> to fight, yes!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why not?
Didn&#8217;t the Greek and Roman and Hebrew and Hun and every other good old
fighter &#8216;strip for the fray&#8217; when he got a chance? Of course! Take off
your shirt, man!&#8221;</p>

<p>I began also to strip for this strange contest whose rules seemed to be made
up from a judicious selection of general principles by Talbot Ward.</p>

<p>My opponent&#8217;s body was as beautiful as his head. The smooth white skin
covered long muscles that rippled beneath it with every slightest motion. The
chest was deep, the waist and hips narrow, the shoulders well rounded. In
contrast my own big prominent muscles, trained by heavy farm work of my early
youth, seemed to move slowly, to knot sluggishly though powerfully. Nevertheless
I judged at a glance that my strength could not but prove greater than his. In a
boxing match his lithe quickness might win&#8211;provided he had the skill to
direct it. But in a genuine fight, within the circumscribed and hampering <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span> dimensions of our little
room, I thought my own rather unusual power must crush him. The only unknown
quantity was the spirit or gameness of us two. I had no great doubt of my own
determination in that respect&#8211;I had been on too many log-drives to fear
personal encounter. And certainly Talbot Ward seemed to show nothing but eager
interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t show up for what you are in your clothes,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;This is going to be more fun than I had thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>My roommates perched on the table and the mantelpiece out of the way. I asked
the length of the rounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rounds!&#8221; echoed Talbot Ward with a flash of teeth beneath his
little moustache. &#8220;Did you ever hear of rounds in a real fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>With the words he sprang forward and hit me twice. The blows started at the
very toe of his foot; and they shook me as no blows, even with the bare fist,
have ever shaken me before or since. Completely dazed, I struck back, but
encountered only the empty air. Four or five times, from somewhere, these
pile-driver fists descended upon me. Being now prepared, to some extent, I
raised my elbows and managed to defend my neck and jaws. The attack was
immediately transferred to my body, but I stiffened my muscles thankfully and
took the punishment. My river and farm work had so hardened me there that I
believe I could have taken the kick of a mule without damage were I expecting
it.</p>

<p>The respite enabled my brain to clear. I recovered slowly from the effect of
those first two vicious blows. I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_13'></a>13</span> saw Ward, his eyes narrowed calculatingly, his body
swinging forward like a whalebone spring, delivering his attack with nice
accuracy. A slow anger glowed through me. He had begun without the least
warning: had caught me absolutely unaware. I hit back.</p>

<p>He was so intent on his own assault, so certain of the blinding effect of his
first attack, that I hit him. I saw his head snap back, and the blood come from
his lips. The blows were weak, for I was still dazed; but they served, together
with the slow burn of my anger, greatly to steady me. We were once more on equal
terms.</p>

<p>For perhaps two minutes I tried to exchange with him. He was in and out like
lightning; he landed on me hard almost every time; he escaped nine out of ten of
my return counters. Decidedly I was getting the worst of this; though my heavier
body took punishment better than his lighter and more nervous frame. Then
suddenly it occurred to me that I was playing his game for him. As long as he
could keep away from me, he was at an advantage. My best chance was to
close.</p>

<p>From that moment I took the aggressive, and was in consequence the more
punished. My rushes to close in were skilfully eluded; and they generally laid
me wide open. My head was singing, and my sight uncertain; though I was in no
real distress. Ward danced away and slipped around tense as a panther.</p>

<p>Then, by a very simple ruse, I got hold of him. I feinted at rushing him,
stopped and hit instead, and then, following closely the blow, managed to seize
his arm. For ten seconds he jerked and twisted and struggled to release <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span> himself. Then suddenly he
gave that up, dove forward, and caught me in a grapevine.</p>

<p>He was a fairly skilful wrestler, and very strong. It was as though he were
made of whalebone springs. But never yet have I met a man of my weight who
possessed the same solid strength; and Ward would tip the scales at considerably
less. I broke his hold, and went after him.</p>

<p>He was as lively as an exceedingly slippery fish. Time after time he all but
wriggled from my grasp; and time after time he broke my hold by sheer agility.
His exertions must have been to him something terrible, for they required every
ounce of his strength at the greatest speed. I could, of course, take it much
easier, and every instant I expected to feel him weaken beneath my hands; but
apparently he was as vigorous as ever. He was in excellent training. At last,
however, I managed to jerk him whirling past me, to throw his feet from under
him, and to drop him beneath me. As he fell he twisted, and by a sheer fluke I
caught his wrist.</p>

<p>Thus through no great skill of my own the fortunes of war had given me a
hammerlock on him. Most people know what that is. Any one else can find out by
placing his forearm across the small of his back and then getting somebody else
to press upward on the forearm. The Greek statue of &#8220;The Wrestlers&#8221;
illustrates it. As the pressure increases, so does the pain. When the pain
becomes intense enough, the wrestler rolls over and the contest is won. Some
people can stand it longer than others; but all sooner or later must give up. In
fact, skilled wrestlers, knowing that otherwise the inevitable end is a broken
arm, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span> save themselves
much tribulation by immediately conceding the bout once this deadly hold is
gained.</p>

<p>I began to force Talbot Ward&#8217;s hand slowly up his back.</p>

<p>Very gently, an inch at a time, I pressed. He said nothing. Once he attempted
to slip sidewise; but finding me of course fully prepared for that, he instantly
ceased struggling. After I had pushed the hand to the hurting point, I
stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>He said nothing.</p>

<p>Now I was young, and none too well disciplined, heated by contest, and very
angry at having been so unexpectedly attacked at the beginning. I was quite
willing to hurt him a little. Slowly and steadily, and, I am ashamed to say,
with considerable satisfaction, I pressed the arm upward. The pain must have
been intense. I could feel the man&#8217;s body quiver between my knees, and saw
the sweat break out afresh. Still he made no sign, but dug his forehead into the
floor. &#8220;I can stand this as long as you can,&#8221; said I to myself
grimly.</p>

<p>But at last I reached the point where I knew that another inch, another
pound, would break the bone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you give up?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he gasped explosively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll break your arm!&#8221; I snarled at him.</p>

<p>He made no reply.</p>

<p>The blood was running into my eyes from a small scrape on my forehead. It was
nothing, but it annoyed me. I was bruised and heated and mad. Every bit of
antagonism <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span> in me was
aroused. As far as I was concerned, it was a very real fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; I growled, &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep you there then,
damn you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Holding the arm in the same position, I settled myself. The pain to the poor
chap must have been something fearful, for every muscle and tendon was stretched
to the cracking point. His breath came and went in sharp hisses; but he gave no
other sign. My heat cooled, though, as I look back on it, far too slowly.
Suddenly I arose and flung him from me. He rolled over on his back, and lay, his
eyes half closed, breathing deeply. We must have been a sweet sight, we two
young barbarians&#8211;myself marked and swollen and bloody, he with one eye
puffed, and pale as death. My roommates, absolutely fascinated, did not
stir.</p>

<p>The tableau lasted only the fraction of a minute, after all. Then abruptly
Talbot Ward sat up. He grinned up at me with his characteristic momentary flash
of teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you you couldn&#8217;t lick me,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>I stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Licked? Why, I had you cold!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have broken your arm, if I had gone any farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I stared into his eyes blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have done it?&#8221; I asked, in a sudden flash of
illumination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; said he, with a faint contempt, as he
arose.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>&#8220;Why did you
hit me at first, as you did? You gave me no warning whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you get any warning in a real fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not controvert this; and yet uneasily, vaguely, I felt there must be
a fallacy somewhere. I had been told and not told, what should, or should not,
be done, in an affair that apparently could have no rules, and yet had
distinctions as to fair and unfair, some of which were explained and some left
as obvious. I felt somewhat confused. But often in my later experience with
Talbot Ward I felt just that way, so in retrospect it does not strike me so
forcibly as it did at that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re a wonder! a perfect wonder!&#8221; Ward was
saying.</p>

<p>Then we all became aware of a knocking and a rattling at the door. It must
have been going on for some time.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t open, I&#8217;ll get the police! I promise you,
I&#8217;ll get the police!&#8221; the voice of our landlady was saying.</p>

<p>We looked at each other aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we must have been making a little noise,&#8221; conceded
Talbot Ward. Noise! It must have sounded as though the house were coming down.
Our ordinary little boxing matches were nothing to it.</p>

<p>Ward threw his military cape around his shoulders, and sank back into a seat
beneath the window. I put on an overcoat. One of the boys let her in.</p>

<p>She was thoroughly angry, and she gave us all notice to go. She had done that
same every Saturday night for a year; but we had always wheedled her out of it.
This time, however, she seemed to mean business. I suppose <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span> we <i>had</i> made a good deal of a riot.
When the fact became evident, I, of course, shouldered the whole responsibility.
Thereupon she turned on me. Unexpectedly Talbot Ward spoke up from the obscurity
of his corner. His clear voice was incisive, but so courteous with the cold
finality of the high-bred aristocrat, that Mrs. Simpkins was cut short in the
middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you, calm yourself, madam,&#8221; said he; &#8220;it is not
worth heating yourself over: for the annoyance, such as it is, will soon be
removed. Mr. Munroe and myself are shortly departing together for
California.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VOYAGE</span></h2>

<p>If I had any scruples&#8211;and I do not remember many&#8211;they were
overcome within the next day or two. It was agreed that I was to go in
Ward&#8217;s employ, he to pay my passage money and all expenses, I to give him
half the gold I might pick up. This seemed to me, at least, an eminently
satisfactory and businesslike arrangement. Ward bought the outfits for both of
us. It turned out that he was a Mexican war veteran&#8211;hence the military
cape&#8211;and in consequence an old campaigner. His experience and my rural
upbringing saved us from most of the ridiculous purchases men made at that time.
We had stout clothes and boots, a waterproof apiece, picks and shovel, blankets
and long strips of canvas, three axes, knives, one rifle, a double shotgun, and
a Colt&#8217;s revolver apiece. The latter seemed to me a wonderful weapon, with
its six charges in the turning cylinder; but I had no opportunity to try it.</p>

<p>Ward decided instantly for the Panama route.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most expensive, but also the quickest,&#8221; said he;
&#8220;a sailing ship around the Horn takes forever; and across the plains is
ditto. Every day we wait, some other fellow is landing in the
diggings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearly every evening he popped into our boarding house, where, owing to the
imminence of my departure, I had been <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_20'></a>20</span> restored to favour. I never did find out where he
lived. We took our passage at the steamship office; we went to the variety shows
and sang <i>Oh, Susannah!</i> with the rest; we strutted a bit, and were only
restrained from donning our flannel shirts and Colt&#8217;s revolving pistols in
the streets of New York by a little remnant, a very little remnant, of common
sense. When the time at last came, we boarded our steamship, and hung over the
rail, and cheered like crazy things. I personally felt as though a lid had been
lifted from my spirit, and that a rolling cloud of enthusiasm was at last
allowed to puff out to fill my heaven.</p>

<p>In two days we were both over being seasick, and had a chance to look around
us. Our ship was a sidewheel steamer of about a thousand tons, and she carried
two hundred and eighty passengers, which was about two hundred more than her
regular complement. They were as miscellaneous a lot as mortal eye ever fell
upon: from the lank Maine Yankee to the tall, sallow, black-haired man from
Louisiana. I suppose, too, all grades of the social order must have been
represented; but in our youth and high spirits we did not go into details of
that sort. Every man, with the exception of a dozen or so, wore a red shirt, a
slouch hat, a revolver and a bowie knife; and most of us had started to grow
beards. Unless one scrutinized closely such unimportant details as features,
ways of speech or manners, one could not place his man&#8217;s former status,
whether as lawyer, physician or roustabout. And we were too busy for that. I
never saw such a busy place as that splattering old ship slowly wallowing her
way south toward the tropical seas. We had fifty-eight thousand things to
discuss, beginning with Marshall&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_21'></a>21</span> first discovery, skipping through the clouds of
rumours of all sorts, down to intimate details of climate, outfit, prospects,
plans, and the best methods of getting at the gold. And to all these subjects we
brought a dozen points of view, each of which was strange to all the others. We
had with us men from every stratum of society, and from every point of the
compass. Each was a product of his own training and mental upbringing, and was
incapable, without great effort, of understanding his neighbour&#8217;s point of
view. Communication and travel were in those days very limited, it must be
remembered, and different communities and sections of the country produced
strong types. With us discussion became an adventurous exploration into a new
country; the man from Maine could not but be interested in finding out what that
strange, straight-haired, dark creature from Carolina might think of even the
most commonplace subject. Only our subjects were not commonplace.</p>

<p>So my chief impression of that voyage down was of knots of men talking
hurriedly and excitedly, as though there were not a moment to waste; and the hum
of voices rising and falling far into the night.</p>

<p>Only two things were capable of breaking in on this tense absorption of the
men in each other and in their subject&#8211;one was dolphins, and the other the
meal gong. When dolphins appeared each rushed promptly to the side of the ship
and discharged his revolver at the beasts. I never saw any harm come from these
fusillades, but they made a wonderful row. Meal times always caught the majority
unaware. They tumbled and jostled down the companionways <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span> only to find the wise and forethoughtful
had preëmpted every chair. Whereupon, with most ludicrous expressions of chagrin
or of assumed nonchalance, they trooped back to meet the laughter of the wise,
if not forethoughtful, who had realized the uselessness of the rush. After a
moment&#8217;s grumbling, however, the discussions were resumed.</p>

<p>There was some quarrelling, but not much. A holiday spirit pervaded the lot;
for they were men cut off from all experience, all accustomed surroundings, all
the restraints of training, and they were embarked on the great adventure. I do
not now remember many of them individually. They were of a piece with the
thousands we were destined to encounter. But I do retain a most vivid mental
picture of them collectively, with their red shirts, their slouch hats, their
belts full of weapons, their eyes of eagerness, their souls of dreams; brimming
with pent energy; theorizing, arguing, disputing; ready at an instant&#8217;s
notice for any sort of a joke or excitement that would relieve the tension;
boisterous, noisy, laughing loudly, smothering by sheer weight of ridicule
individual resentments&#8211;altogether a wonderful picture of the youth and
hope and energy and high spirits of the time.</p>

<p>Never before nor since have I looked upon such a variety of equipment as
strewed the decks and cabins of that ship. A great majority of the passengers
knew nothing whatever about out-of-door life, and less than nothing as to the
conditions in California and on the way. Consequently they had bought liberally
of all sorts of idiotic patent contraptions. India rubber played a prominent
part. And the deck was cumbered with at least forty sorts of machines <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span> for separating gold from
the soil: some of them to use water, some muscular labour, and one tremendous
affair with wings was supposed to fan away everything but the gold. Differing in
everything else, they were alike in one thing: they had all been devised by men
who had never seen any but manufactured gold. I may add that I never saw a
machine of the kind actually at work in the diggings.</p>

<p>Just now, however, I looked on the owners of these contraptions with envy,
and thought ourselves at a disadvantage with only our picks, shovels, and
axes.</p>

<p>But we had with us a wonderful book that went far toward cheering up the
poorly equipped. Several copies had been brought aboard, so we all had a chance
to read it. The work was entitled &#8220;Three Weeks in the Gold Mines,&#8221;
and was written by a veracious individual who signed himself H. I. Simpson. I
now doubt if he had ever left his New York hall bedroom, though at the time we
took his statements for plain truth. Simpson could spare only ten days of this
three weeks for actual mining. In that period, with no other implement than a
pocket knife, he picked out fifty thousand dollars. The rest of the time he
preferred to travel about and see the country, picking up only what incidental
nuggets he came across while walking. We believed this.</p>

<p>As we drew southward the days became insufferably warm, but the nights were
glorious. Talbot and I liked to sleep on the deck; and generally camped down up
near the bitts. The old ship rolled frightfully, for she was light in freight in
order to accommodate so many passengers; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_24'></a>24</span> and the dark blue sea appeared to swoop up and down
beneath the placid tropic moon.</p>

<p>We had many long, quiet talks up there; but in them all I learned nothing,
absolutely nothing, of my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had broken my arm that time, I should not have taken
you,&#8221; he remarked suddenly one evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted that kind of a man,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;for I should doubt my control of him. But you gave
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>This nettled me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have had me, or any man, brute enough to go through with
it?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;&#8211;he hesitated&#8211;&#8220;it was agreed that it was
to be <i>fight</i>, you remember. And after all, if you had broken my arm, it
would have been my fault and not yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two young fellows used occasionally to join us in our swooping, plunging
perch. They were as unlike as two men could be, and yet already they had become
firm friends. One was a slow, lank, ague-stricken individual from somewhere in
the wilds of the Great Lakes, his face lined and brown as though carved from
hardwood, his speed slow, his eyes steady with a veiled sardonic humour. His
companion was scarcely more than a boy, and he came, I believe, from Virginia.
He was a dark, eager youth, with a mop of black shiny hair that he was always
tossing back, bright glowing eyes, a great enthusiasm of manner, and an
imagination alert to catch fire. The backwoodsman seemed attracted to the boy by
this very quick and unsophisticated bubbling of candid youth; while the boy most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span> evidently worshipped
his older companion as a symbol of the mysterious frontier. The Northerner was
named Rogers, but was invariably known as Yank. The Southerner had some such
name as Fairfax, but was called Johnny, and later in California, for reasons
that will appear, Diamond Jack. Yank&#8217;s distinguishing feature was a
long-barrelled &#8220;pea shooter&#8221; rifle. He never moved ten feet without
it.</p>

<p>Johnny usually did most of the talking when we were all gathered together.
Yank and I did the listening and Talbot the interpellating. Johnny swarmed all
over himself like a pickpocket, and showed us everything he had in the way of
history, manners, training, family, pride, naïveté, expectations and hopes. He
prided himself on being a calm, phlegmatic individual, unemotional and not
easily excited, and he constantly took this attitude. It was a lovely joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it won&#8217;t be necessary to stay
out more than a year. They tell me I can easily make eleven hundred dollars a
day; but you know I am not easily moved by such reports&#8221;&#8211;he was at
the time moving under a high pressure, at least ten knots an hour&#8211;&#8220;I
shall be satisfied with three hundred a day. Allowing three hundred working days
to the year, that gives me about ninety thousand
dollars&#8211;plenty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have a few expenses,&#8221; suggested Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&#8211;yes&#8211;well, make it a year and a half, just to be on the
safe side.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny was eagerly anxious to know everybody on the ship, with the exception
of about a dozen from his own South. As far as I could see they did not in the
slightest <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span> degree
differ except in dress from any of the other thirty or forty from that section,
but Johnny distinguished. He stiffened as though Yank&#8217;s gunbarrel had
taken the place of his spine whenever one of these men was near; and he was so
coldly and pointedly courteous that I would have slapped his confounded face if
he had acted so to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Johnny,&#8221; I said to him one day, &#8220;what&#8217;s
the matter with those fellows? They look all right to me. What do you know
against them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never laid eyes on them before in my life, sir,&#8221; he replied,
stiffening perceptibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take that kink out of your back,&#8221; I warned him. &#8220;That
won&#8217;t work worth a cent with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon. They are not gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by gentlemen,&#8221; said I;
&#8220;it&#8217;s a wide term. But lots of us here aren&#8217;t
gentlemen&#8211;far, far from it. But you seem to like us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knit his brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain. They are the class of cheap politician that
brings into disrepute the chivalry of the South, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot and I burst into a shout of laughter, and even Yank, leaning
attentively on the long barrel of his pea rifle, grinned faintly. We caught
Johnny up on that word&#8211;and he was game enough to take it well. Whenever
something particularly bad happened to be also Southern, we called it the
Chivalry. The word caught hold; so that later it came to be applied as a generic
term to the Southern wing of venal politicians that early tried to control the
new state of California.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>I must confess
that if I had been Johnny I should have stepped more carefully with these men.
They were a dark, suave lot, and dressed well. In fact, they and a half dozen
obviously professional men alone in all that ship wore what we would call
civilized clothes. I do not know which was more incongruous&#8211;our own red
shirts, or the top hats, flowing skirts, and light pantaloons of these quietly
courteous gentlemen. They were quite as well armed as ourselves, however,
wearing their revolvers beneath their armpits, or carrying short double pistols.
They treated Johnny with an ironically exaggerated courtesy, and paid little
attention to his high airs. It was obvious, however, that he was making
enemies.</p>

<p>Talbot Ward knew everybody aboard, from the captain down. His laughing,
half-aloof manner was very taking; and his ironical comments on the various
points of discussion, somehow, conveyed no sting. He was continually accepting
gifts of newspapers&#8211;of which there were a half a thousand or so brought
aboard&#8211;with every appearance of receiving a favour. These papers he
carried down to our tiny box of a room and added to his bundle. I supposed at
the time he was doing all this on Molière&#8217;s principle, that one gains more
popularity by accepting a favour than by bestowing one.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VILLAGE BY THE LAGOON</span></h2>

<p>In the early morning one day we came in sight of a round high bluff with a
castle atop, and a low shore running away. The ship&#8217;s man told us this was
Chagres.</p>

<p>This news caused a curious disintegration in the ship&#8217;s company. We had
heretofore lived together a good-humoured community. Now we immediately drew
apart into small suspicious groups. For we had shortly to land ourselves and our
goods, and to obtain transportation across the Isthmus; and each wanted to be
ahead of his neighbour.</p>

<p>Here the owners of much freight found themselves at a disadvantage. I began
to envy less the proprietors of those enormous or heavy machines for the
separation of gold. Each man ran about on the deck collecting busily all his
belongings into one pile. When he had done that, he spent the rest of his time
trying to extract definite promises from the harassed ship&#8217;s officers that
he should go ashore in the first boat.</p>

<p>Talbot and I sat on our few packages and enjoyed the scene. The ship came to
anchor and the sailors swung the boat down from the davits. The passengers
crowded around in a dense, clamouring mob. We arose, shouldered our effects, and
quietly slipped <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
around to the corresponding boat on the other side the ship. Sure enough, that
also was being lowered. So that we and a dozen who had made the same good guess,
were, after all, the first to land.</p>

<p>The town proved to be built on low ground in a bay the other side the castle
and the hill. It must be remembered that I had never travelled. The cane houses
or huts, with their high peaked roofs thatched with palm leaves, the straight
palms in the background against the sky, the morasses all about, the squawk and
flop of strange, long-legged marsh birds, the glare of light, the queer looking
craft beached on the mud, and the dark-skinned, white-clad figures awaiting
us&#8211;all these struck strongly at my imagination.</p>

<p>We beached in the mud, and were at once surrounded by a host of little,
brown, clamorous men. Talbot took charge, and began to shoot back Spanish at a
great rate. Some of the little men had a few words of English. Our goods were
seized, and promptly disappeared in a dozen directions. I tried to prevent this,
but could only collar one man at a time. All the Americans were swearing and
threatening at a great rate. I saw Johnny, tearing up the beach after a fleet
native, fall flat and full length in the mud, to the vast delight of all who
beheld.</p>

<p>Finally Talbot ploughed his way to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all settled,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made a
bargain with my friend here to take us up in his boat to Cruces for fifteen
dollars apiece for four of us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;Well, if
you need two more, for heaven&#8217;s sake rescue Johnny,&#8221; I advised.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll have apoplexy.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hailed Johnny and explained matters. Johnny was somewhat put to it to
attain his desired air of imperturbable calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got every blistered thing I own, and made off with
it!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Confound it, sir, I&#8217;m going to shoot every
saddle-coloured hound in the place if I don&#8217;t get back my
belongings!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got our stuff, too,&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, keep calm,&#8221; advised Talbot. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know the
game down here, but it strikes me they can&#8217;t get very far through these
swamps, if they <i>do</i> try to steal, and I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re
stealing anyway; the whole performance to me bears a strong family resemblance
to hotel runners. Here, <i>compadre</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He talked a few moments with his boatman.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he told us, then. &#8220;Come
on!&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked along the little crescent of beach, looking into each of the boats
in the long row drawn up on the shore. They were queer craft, dug out from the
trunks of trees, with small decks in bow and stern, and with a low roof of
palmetto leaves amidships. By the time we had reached the end of the row we had
collected all our effects. Our own boatman stowed them in his craft.</p>

<p>Thereupon, our minds at rest, we returned to the landing to enjoy the scene.
The second ship&#8217;s boat had beached, and the row was going on, worse than
before. In the seething, cursing, shouting mass we caught sight <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span> of Yank&#8217;s tall
figure leaning imperturbably on his rifle muzzle. We made our way to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got your boat yet?&#8221; Talbot shouted at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got nothin&#8217; yet but a headache in the ears,&#8221; said
Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with us then. Where&#8217;s your plunder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yank stooped and swung to his shoulder a small bundle tied with ropes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all thar,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>These matters settled, we turned with considerable curiosity to the little
village itself. It was all exotic, strange. Everything was different, and we saw
it through the eyes of youth and romance as epitomizing the storied tropics.</p>

<p>There were perhaps a couple of hundred of the cane huts arranged roughly
along streets in which survived the remains of crude paving. All else was a
morass. Single palm trees shot up straight, to burst like rockets in a falling
star of fronds. Men and women, clad in a single cotton shift reaching to the
knees, lounged in the doorways or against the frail walls, smoking cigars.
Pot-bellied children, stark naked, played everywhere, but principally in the
mudholes and on the offal dumps. Innumerable small, hairless dogs were
everywhere about, a great curiosity to us, who had never even heard of such
things. We looked into some of the interiors, but saw nothing in the way of
decent furniture. The cooking appeared to be done between two stones. A grand
tropical smell hung low in the air. On the thresholds of the doors, inside the
houses, in the middle of the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_32'></a>32</span> streets, anywhere, everywhere, were old fish, the
heads of cattle, drying hides, all sorts of carrion, most of it well decomposed.
Back of the town was a low, rank jungle of green, and a stagnant lake. The
latter had a delicate border of greasy blue mud.</p>

<p>Johnny and I wandered about completely fascinated. Talbot and Yank did not
seem so impressed. Finally Talbot called a halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all very well; if you kids like to look at yellow fever,
blackjack, and corruption, all right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve got
to start pretty soon after noon, and in the meantime where do we eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>We returned through the town. It was now filled to overflowing with our
compatriots. They surged everywhere, full of comment and curiosity. The
half-naked men and women with the cigars, and the wholly naked children and
dogs, seemed not in the least disturbed nor enlivened.</p>

<p>Talbot&#8217;s earnest inquiries finally got us to the Crescent Hotel. It was
a hut exactly like all the rest, save that it had a floor. From its name I
suppose it must have been kept by a white man, but we never got near enough
through the crowd to find out. Without Talbot we should have gone hungry, with
many others, but he inquired around until we found a native willing to feed us.
So we ate on an upturned hencoop outside a native hut. The meal consisted of
pork, bread, and water.</p>

<p>We strolled to the beach at the hour appointed with our boatman. He was not
there; nor any other boatman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>&#8220;Never
mind,&#8221; said Ward; &#8220;I&#8217;ll know him if I see him. I&#8217;ll go
look him up. You fellows find the boat with our things in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He and I reëntered the village, but a fifteen minutes&#8217; search failed to
disclose our man. Therefore we returned to the beach. A crowd was gathered close
about some common centre in the unmistakable restless manner of men about a dog
fight or some other kind of a row. We pushed our way in.</p>

<p>Johnny and Yank were backed up against the palmetto awning of one of the
boats in an attitude of deadly and quiet menace. Not two yards away stood four
of our well-dressed friends. Nobody as yet displayed a weapon, except that
Yank&#8217;s long rifle lay across the hollow of his left arm instead of butt to
earth; but it was evident that lightnings were playing. The boatman, who had
appeared, alone was saying anything, but he seemed to be supplying language for
the lot.</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s tense, alert attitude relaxed a little when he saw us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; inquired Ward easily. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yank and I found our goods dumped out on the beach, and others in
their place,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you proceeded to reverse matters? How about it?&#8221; he inquired
pleasantly of the four men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about it,&#8221; replied one of them shortly. &#8220;We
hired this boat, and we intend to have it; and no whipper-snapper is going to
keep us from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Talbot pleasantly. &#8220;Well, excuse me <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span> a moment while I talk to
our friend.&#8221; He addressed the man in Spanish, and received short, sullen
replies. &#8220;He says,&#8221; Talbot explained to us, &#8220;that he never saw
us before in his life, and never agreed to take us up the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that settles it,&#8221; stated the other man.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much did you offer to pay him?&#8221; asked Talbot.</p>

<p>The man stared. &#8220;None of your business,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re askin&#8217; twenty dollars a head,&#8221; volunteered
one of the interested spectators.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. You see,&#8221; said Talbot to us, &#8220;we got here a
little too early. Our bargain was for only fifteen dollars; and now this worthy
citizen has made a better rate for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have had the bargain immediately registered before the
<i>alcalde</i>, señor,&#8221; spoke up a white-dressed Spaniard of the better
class, probably from the castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, señor,&#8221; said Talbot courteously. &#8220;That
neglect is due to my ignorance of your charming country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now if you&#8217;ll move, young turkey cock, we&#8217;ll just take
our boat,&#8221; said another of the claimants.</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment!&#8221; said Talbot Ward, with a new edge to his voice.
&#8220;This is my boat, not yours; my baggage is in it, my boatman is on the
ground. That he is forgetful has nothing to do with the merits of the case. You
know this as well as I do. Now you can acknowledge <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span> this peacefully and get out, or you can
fight. I don&#8217;t care a continental red copper which. Only I warn you, the
first man who makes a move with anything but his two feet will be shot
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood, his hands hanging idly by his sides, and he spoke very quietly. The
four men were not cowards, that I&#8217;ll swear; but one and all they stared
into Ward&#8217;s eyes, and came individually to the same conclusion. I do not
doubt that dancing flicker of refraction&#8211;or of devilment&#8211;was very
near the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if you are very positive, I should not dream of doubting
your word or of interfering,&#8221; said the tallest and quietest, who had
remained in the background. &#8220;We desire to do injustice to no
man&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny, behind us, snorted loudly and derisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my knowledge of Spanish is of any value in assisting you to a boat,
pray command me,&#8221; broke in Ward.</p>

<p>The crowd moved off, the boatman with it. I reached out and collared him.</p>

<p>Talbot had turned on Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fairfax,&#8221; said he icily, &#8220;one of the first things you must
learn is not to stir things up again once a victory is gained. Those men were
sore; and you took the best method possible of bringing on a real
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Johnny flushed to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said he in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>Talbot Ward thawed completely, and a most winning smile illumined his
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s what I call handsome, Johnny!&#8221; he <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span> cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s
pretty hard to admit the wrong. You and Yank certainly looked bold and warlike
when he came along. Where&#8217;s that confounded <i>mozo</i>? Oh, you have him,
Frank. Good boy! Come here, my amiable citizen. I guess you understand English
after all, or you couldn&#8217;t have bargained so shrewdly with our blackleg
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flush slowly faded from Johnny&#8217;s face. Yank&#8217;s sole
contribution to the changed conditions was to spit with great care, and to shift
the butt of his rifle to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Talbot was admonishing the boatman, &#8220;that was very
bad. When you make a bargain, stick to it. But I&#8217;ll tell you what I will
do. I will ask all people, <i>sabe</i>, everywhere, your people, my people, and
if everybody pay twenty dollars, then we pay twenty dollars. <i>Sabe?</i> But we
no pay twenty dollars unless you get us to Cruces <i>poco pronto, sabe</i>? Now
we start.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boatman broke into a torrent of talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Says he&#8217;s got to find his assistant,&#8221; Talbot explained to
us. &#8220;Come on, my son, I&#8217;ll just go with you after that precious
assistant.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat on the edge of our boat for half an hour, watching the most comical
scenes. Everybody was afflicted with the same complaint&#8211;absence of
boatmen. Some took possession, and settled themselves patiently beneath their
little roofs. Others made forays and returned dragging protesting natives by the
arm. These generally turned out to be the wrong <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_37'></a>37</span> natives; but that was a mere detail. Once in a lucky
while the full boat&#8217;s complement would be gathered; and then the craft
would pull away up the river to the tune of pistol shots and vociferous
yells.</p>

<p>At the end of the period mentioned Talbot and the two men appeared. They were
quite amicable; indeed, friendly, and laughed together as they came. The
&#8220;assistant&#8221; proved to be a tremendous negro, nearly naked, with fine
big muscles, and a good-natured, grinning face. He wore large brass ear circlets
and bracelets of copper. We all pushed the canoe to the very edge of the water
and clambered aboard. The negro bent his mighty shoulders. We were afloat.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>A TROPICAL RIVER</span></h2>

<p>Our <i>padrone</i>, as Talbot told us we should call him, stood in front clad
in a coloured muslin shirt. The broad sluggish river was alive with boats, all
making their way against the current. By the time the lagoon had narrowed,
however, they had pretty well scattered.</p>

<p>We entered a tropical forest, and never shall I forget the wonder of it. The
banks were lined to the water&#8217;s edge with vegetation, so that one could
see nothing but the jungle. There were great palm trees, which we recognized;
and teak trees, which we did not, but which Talbot identified for us. It was a
very bald sort of tree, as I remember it. Then there were tremendous sycamores
in which were ants&#8217; nests as big as beehives; and banana trees with torn
leaves, probably the most exotic touch of all; and beautiful noble mangoes like
domes of a green cathedral; and various sorts of canes and shrubs and lilies
growing among them. And everywhere leaped and swung the vines&#8211;thick ropy
vines; knotted vines, like knotted cables; slender filament vines; spraying
gossamer vines, with gorgeous crimson, purple, and yellow blooms; and long
streamers that dipped to trail in the waters. Below them were broad pads of
lotus and water lilies; with alligators like barnacled <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span> logs, and cormorants swimming about, and
bright-eyed waterfowl. The shadows in the forest were light clear green, and the
shadows under the hanging jungle near the water were dull green; and the very
upper air itself, in that hot steaming glade, seemed delicately green, too.
Butterflies were among the vine blossoms, so brilliant of colour that it seemed
to me that the flowers were fluttering from their stems. Across the translucent
green shadows flashed birds. I recognized little green paroquets. I had never
before seen them outside of cages. No man can realize the wonder of finding
himself actually part of romantic scenes so long familiar in the pages of books
that they have become almost mythical. We sat there absolutely silent, save when
calling attention to some new marvel, drinking it in.</p>

<p>Our men paddled steadily ahead. The negro hummed strange minor songs to
himself. Suddenly he flashed his teeth at us and broke into full voice:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Susannah! don&#8217;t cry for me!<br /> I&#8217;m off to
California wid my banjo on my knee.&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>The accent was queer, but the words and tune were right. Talbot questioned
him in Spanish.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says all Americans sing it. He has taken many up the
river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too many,&#8221; muttered Johnny. &#8220;I wish we&#8217;d started
three months sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was growing dusk when we came in sight of a village of bamboo huts on the
right bank. To this we headed. Hardly had the boat struck the beach when <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span> both of our men leaped
ashore and raced madly toward the huts. Pausing only long enough to slide the
boat beyond the grip of the river, we followed, considerably mystified. Quick as
we were, we found both the <i>padrone</i> and his man, together with a dozen
others, already seated at a <i>monte</i> table. The <i>padrone</i> was acting as
banker!</p>

<p>We discovered the name of this place to be Gatun. Talbot found us a native
hut in which were hammocks we could rent for the night. The hut was a
two-storied affair, with a notched pole by which to clamber aloft. I took one
look and decided to stay below. My weight seemed sufficient to bring the whole
thing down about our ears.</p>

<p>I do not know which had the better of it. My hammock was slung across one
corner of the single room. A cooking fire blazed merrily five or six feet away.
Some ten or a dozen natives were drinking and talking until nearly morning; and
to my personal knowledge some ten or a dozen thousand fleas were doing the same.
Six dogs were that hut&#8217;s allowance. They discovered that my weight sagged
my hammock down to a height just suitable for the rubbing of their backs. In
vain I smote with boot or pistol barrel. They kiyied and departed; but only for
a moment. I had not even time to fall into a doze before one of the others was
back at it. This amused the drinking natives. I suppose the poor beasts very
passionately wanted to scratch their backs. I could sympathize with them; none
of them could have had as many fleas <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_41'></a>41</span> as I had, for their superficial area was not as
great; but perhaps they had as many per square inch.</p>

<p>In the course of the night it began to rain. I mean really rain,
&#8220;without going into details as to drops,&#8221; as somebody has said. Then
I ceased envying my friends upstairs; for from all sounds I judged the roof was
leaking.</p>

<p>Next morning it was still drizzling. The town was full of sad-eyed, wearied
men. I think every one had had about the same experience. The <i>padrone</i> was
at first a little inclined to delay; but he quickly recognized that our mood was
bad, so shortly we were under way.</p>

<p>That day was not an unmitigated joy. It rained, picking the surface of the
river up in little spots and rings. The forest dripped steadily. All the
butterflies and bright birds had disappeared; and sullen, shifting clouds fairly
touched the treetops. It was cold. Wrap ourselves as we would, we became
thoroughly chilled. We should have liked to go ashore for a little fire, or at
least a tramp about; but there seemed to be no banks, and the vegetation would
not let us approach whatever earth there might be. The <i>padrone</i> and the
big negro thrust their heads through holes cut in the middle of their blankets,
and seemed happy. Talbot Ward and Yank took it with the philosophy of old
campaigners; but Johnny and I had not had experience enough to realize that
things have a habit of coming to an end. We were too wet even to smoke.</p>

<p>That night we spent at a place called Pena Blanca, which differed in no
essential from Gatun. We slept there in small sheds, along with twenty or thirty
of our ship&#8217;s companions wedged tightly together. A dozen other similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span> sheds adjoined. We
were all quarrelsome and disinclined to take much nonsense either from the
natives or from each other. Also we needed and wanted food; and we had
difficulty in getting it. A dozen incipient quarrels were extinguished because
the majority of the crowd would not stand for being bothered by the row. Finally
the whole hutful became involved, and it really looked for a moment like a riot.
A good deal of bad language flew about, and men seized their weapons. Yank rose
to the occasion by appealing to them not &#8220;to kick up a muss,&#8221;
because there was &#8220;a lady of our own colour in the next room.&#8221; The
lady was mythical, but the riot was averted.</p>

<p>The next day was clearing, with occasional heavy dashing showers, just to
keep us interested. The country began more to open up. We passed many grass
savannahs dotted with palms and a tree something like our locust. Herds of
cattle fed there. The river narrowed and became swifter. Often our men had to
lay aside their paddles in favour of the pole or tracking line. Once or twice we
landed and walked for a short distance along the banks. At one place we saw
several wild turkeys. At another something horrifying, rustling, and reptilian
made a dash fairly from between my feet, and rushed <i>flop</i> into the water.
The boys claimed I jumped straight upward four feet; but I think it was nearer
ten. Talbot said the thing was an iguana. I should like very much to be able to
describe it accurately, but my observation was somewhat confused. Beyond the
evident fact that it snorted actual fire, I am not prepared to go.</p>

<p>Along in the early afternoon we reached bolder shores in which the trap rock
descended sheer beneath the surface of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_43'></a>43</span> the water. Directly ahead of us rose a mountain like
a cone of verdure. We glided around the base of it, and so came to Gorgona,
situated on a high bluff beyond. This we had decided upon as the end of our
river journey. To be sure we had bargained for Cruces, six miles beyond; but as
the majority of our ship&#8217;s companions had decided on that route, we
thought the Gorgona trail might be less crowded. So we beached our boat, and
unloaded our effects; and set forth to find accommodations for the present, and
mules for the immediate future.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VILLAGE IN THE JUNGLE</span></h2>

<p>At first there seemed slight chance of getting either. The place was crowded
beyond its capacity. The Hotel Française&#8211;a shed-and-tent sort of
combination with a muddy natural floor&#8211;was jammed. The few native huts
were crowded. Many we saw making themselves as comfortable as possible amid
their effects out in the open. Some we talked with said they had been there for
over a week, unable to move because of lack of transportation. They reported
much fever; and in fact we saw one poor shaking wretch, wistful-eyed as a sick
dog, braced against a tree all alone. The spirit was drained out of him; and all
he wanted was to get back.</p>

<p>While we were discussing what to do next, our muslin-clad ex-<i>padrone</i>,
who had been paid and shaken by the hand some time since, approached smoking a
longer cigar than ever. This he waved at us in a most debonair and friendly
manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bread on the water,&#8221; commented Talbot after a short
conversation. &#8220;He says we have treated him like a brother and a true
comrade in arms; which means that <i>I</i> did; you fellows, confound your
spiteful souls, wanted to throw him overboard a dozen times. And now he says to
follow him, and he&#8217;ll get us a place to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;Some native
pig-sty with fleas,&#8221; I remarked skeptically, aside, to Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;You com&#8217;,&#8221; begged the <i>padrone</i>, with a flash of
teeth.</p>

<p>We came bearing our household goods, because we could nowhere see any one to
bear them for us. At that we had to leave the heaviest pieces on the beach.
Talbot insisted on lugging his huge bundle of newspapers.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may come in handy,&#8221; he answered us vaguely. &#8220;Well,
they&#8217;re mine, and this is my back,&#8221; he countered to Johnny&#8217;s
and my impatience with such foolishness.</p>

<p>The <i>padrone</i> led us through town to the outskirts. There we came to a
substantial low house of several rooms, with a veranda and veritable chimneys.
The earth in front had been beaten so hard that even the downpour of yesterday
had not appreciably softened it. To our summons appeared a very suave and
courteous figure&#8211;that, it appeared, of the <i>alcalde</i> of the
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;My fren&#8217;,&#8221; explained the <i>padrone</i> in English, for
our benefit, &#8220;they good peepele. They wan&#8217; estay. Got no place
estay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>alcalde</i>, a portly gentleman with side whiskers and a great deal of
dignity, bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My house is all yours,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Thus, although arriving late, we stopped at the best quarters in the town.
The sense of obligation to any one but our boatman was considerably relieved
when next day we paid what we owed for our lodging. Also, had it not been for
Talbot and Johnny, I am sure Yank and I would have taken to the jungle. There
seemed to be required so much bowing, smiling, punctiliousness and elaborate
complimenting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> that
in a short time I felt myself in the precise mental attitude of a very small
monkey shaking the bars of his cage with all four hands and gibbering in the
face of some benign and infinitely superior professor. I fairly ached behind the
ears trying to look sufficiently alert and bland and intelligent. Yank sat
stolid, chewed tobacco and spat out of the window, which also went far toward
stampeding me. Talbot and Johnny, however, seemed right at home. They capped the
old gentleman&#8217;s most elaborate and involved speeches, they talked at
length and pompously about nothing at all; their smiles were rare and sad and
lingering&#8211;not a bit like my imbecile though well-meant grinning&#8211;and
they seemed to be able to stick it out until judgment day. Not until I heard
their private language after it was all over did I realize they were not
enjoying the occasion thoroughly.</p>

<p>Toward sunset occurred a welcome break. A mob of natives suddenly burst into
view, from the direction of town. They were running madly, led by a very little
man and a very big man. The two latter rushed up to the edge of the veranda, on
which we were all sitting, and began to talk excitedly, both at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row?&#8221; we asked Talbot in a breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t make out yet; something about a fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>alcalde</i> commanded order. Then the matter became clear. The very
large man and the very little man had had a fight, and they had come for
justice. This much Talbot made plain. Then he chuckled explosively.</p>

<p>&#8220;The little man is making his accusation against himself!&#8221; he
told us. &#8220;He is charging <i>himself</i> with having <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span> assaulted and beaten the other fellow.
And the big one is charging <i>himself</i> with having licked the little one.
Neither wants to acknowledge he got licked; and each would rather pay a fine and
have it entered on the records that he won the fight. So much for sheer
vanity!&#8221;</p>

<p>Each had his desire. The <i>alcalde</i>, with beautiful impartiality, fined
them both; and nonchalantly pocketed the proceeds.</p>

<p>At dusk millions of fireflies came out, the earth grew velvet black, and the
soft, tepid air breathed up from the river. Lights of the town flickered like
larger yellower fireflies through the thin screen of palms and jungle; and the
various noises, subdued by distance, mingled with the voices of thousands of
insects, and a strange booming from the river. I thought it very pleasant; and
wanted to stay out; but for some reason we were haled within. There the lamps
made the low broad room very hot. We sat on real chairs and the stilted exchange
resumed. I have often wondered whether our host enjoyed it, or whether he did it
merely from duty, and was as heartily bored as the rest of us.</p>

<p>A half-naked servant glided in to tell us that we were wanted in the next
room. We found there our good <i>padrone</i> and another, a fine tall man,
dressed very elaborately in short jacket and slit loose trousers, all sewn with
many silver buttons and ornaments.</p>

<p>&#8220;He my fren&#8217;,&#8221; explained the <i>padrone</i>. &#8220;He have
dose <i>mulas</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the gorgeous individual Talbot concluded a bargain. He was to furnish us
riding animals at ten dollars each per <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_48'></a>48</span> day; and agreed to transport our baggage at six
dollars a hundredweight. The <i>padrone</i> stood aside, smiling cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ver&#8217; good fren&#8217;? Eh?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; said Talbot with feeling, &#8220;you&#8217;re a
gentleman and a scholar; indeed, I would go farther and designate you as a
genuine lallapaloozer!&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>padrone</i> seemed much gratified; but immediately demanded five
dollars. This Talbot gave him. Johnny thought the demand went far toward
destroying the value of the <i>padrone&#8217;s</i> kindness: but the rest of us
differed. I believe this people, lazy and dishonest as they are, are
nevertheless peculiarly susceptible to kindness. The man had started by trying
to cheat us of our bargain; he ended by going out of his way to help us
along.</p>

<p>At supper, which was served very shortly, we had our first glimpse of the
ladies of the establishment. The older was a very dignified, placid, rather fat
individual, whose chief feature was her shining dark hair. She bowed to us
gravely, said a few words in Spanish, and thereafter applied herself with
childlike and unfeigned zest to the edibles. The younger, Mercedes by name, was
a very sprightly damsel indeed. She too had shining black hair, over which she
had flung the most coquettish sort of lace shawl they call a <i>rebosa</i>. Her
eyes were large, dark, and expressive; and she constantly used them most
provocatively, though with every appearance of shyness and modesty. Her figure,
too, was lithe and rounded; and so swathed, rather than clothed, that every
curve was emphasized. I suppose this effect was the result of the Spanish mode
rather than of individual <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_49'></a>49</span> sophistication; just as the succession of lazy poses
and bendings were the result of a racial feminine instinct rather than of
conscious personal coquetry. Certainly we four red-shirted tramps were poor
enough game. Nevertheless, whatever the motive, the effect was certainly real
enough. She was alluring rather than charming, with her fan and her
<i>rebosa</i>, her veiled glances, her languorous, bold poses, and the single
red flower in her hair. And a great deal of this allurement resided in the very
fact that no one could tell how much was simple, innocent, and unconscious
instinct, and how much was intended. An unpleasing note in both women was
furnished by the powder. This so liberally covered their faces as to conceal the
skin beneath a dead mat white.</p>

<p>Yank and I were kept out of it, or thought we were, by our ignorance of the
language. This did not seem to hinder Johnny in the least. In five minutes he
was oblivious to everything but his attempts to make himself agreeable by signs
and laughing gestures, and to his trials&#8211;with help&#8211;at the unknown
language. The girl played up to him well. Talbot was gravely and courteously
polite. At the close of the meal the women rose suddenly, bowed, and swept from
the room. Johnny turned back to us a good deal flushed and excited, a little
bewildered, and considerably disappointed. The <i>alcalde</i> looked as though
nothing unusual were under way. The rest of us were considerably amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see her later,&#8221; soothed Talbot mockingly.</p>

<p>Johnny gulped down his coffee without reply.</p>

<p>After the meal we went outside. Fires had been built on <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span> opposite sides of the hard beaten earth
in front of the house. Four men with guitars sat chair tilted, backed against
the veranda. Thirty or forty people wandered to and fro. They were of the usual
native class; our host&#8217;s family, and one other, consisting of parents and
three grown children, seemed to represent all the aristocracy. These
better-class guests came to join us on the veranda. The older people did not
greatly differ from our host and his wife, except in cut of masculine whisker,
or amount of feminine fat. The younger members consisted of a young lady, tall
and graceful, a young girl in white, and a man of twenty or thereabout. He was
most gaudily gotten up, for a male creature, in a soft white shirt, a short
braided jacket of blue, a wide, red-tasselled sash, and trousers slit from the
knees down. The entire costume was sewn at all places, likely and unlikely, with
silver buttons. As he was a darkly handsome chap, with a small moustache, red
lips and a little flash of teeth, the effect was quite good, but I
couldn&#8217;t care for his style. The bulk of the villagers were dressed in
white. The women all carried the <i>rebosa</i>, and were thickly powdered. We
could see a number of the Americans in the background.</p>

<p>The musicians struck up a strummy, decided sort of marchlike tune; and the
dancers paired off. They performed a kind of lancer figure, very stately and
solemn, seemingly interminable, with scant variation, small progressions, and
mighty little interest to me. We sat in a stiff row and shed the compliment of
our presence on the scene. It was about as inspiring as a visit to a hospital
ward. What determined the duration of the affair, I <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span> cannot tell you; whether the
musicians&#8217; fingers gave out, or the dancers&#8217; legs, or the official
audience&#8217;s patience. But at last they ceased.</p>

<p>At the beginning of another tune, of much the same solemn character, our
young visitor bowed ceremoniously to our host&#8217;s daughter, and led her down
the steps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Johnny, be a sport. Dance this one,&#8221; said Talbot
rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know how,&#8221; replied Johnny gloomily, his eyes on the
receding figure of Mercedes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lady&#8217;ll show you. Come along!&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot bowed gravely to the young girl, who arose enchanted. Johnny, with his
natural grace and courtesy, offered his arm to the other. She took it with a
faintly aloof and indifferent smile, and descended the step with him. She did
not look toward him, nor did she vouchsafe him a word. Plainly, she was not
interested, but stood idly flirting with her fan, her eyes fixed upon the
distance. The dance began.</p>

<p>It was another of the same general character as the first. The couples
advanced and retreated, swung slowly about each other, ducked and passed beneath
each other&#8217;s arms, all to the stately strumming of the guitars. They kept
on doing these things. Johnny and Talbot soon got hold of the sequence of
events, and did them too.</p>

<p>At first Johnny was gloomy and distrait. Then, after he had, in the changes
of the dance, passed Mercedes a few times, he began to wake up. I could make out
in the firelight only the shapes of their figures and the whiteness of their
faces; but I could see that she lingered a moment <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span> in Johnny&#8217;s formal embrace, that
she flirted against him in passing, and I could guess that her eyes were on
duty. When they returned to the veranda, Johnny was chipper, the visitor darkly
frowning, Mercedes animated, and the other girl still faintly and aloofly
smiling.</p>

<p>The fandango went on for an hour; and the rivalry between Johnny and the
young Spaniard grew in intensity. Certainly Mercedes did nothing to modify it.
The scene became more animated and more interesting. A slow, gliding waltz was
danced, and several posturing, stamping dances in which the partners advanced
and receded toward and from each other, bending and swaying and holding aloft
their arms. It was very pretty and graceful and captivating; and to my
unsophisticated mind a trifle suggestive; though that thought was probably the
result of my training and the novelty of the sight. It must be remembered that
many people see harm in our round dances simply because they have not become
sufficiently accustomed to them to realize that the position of the performers
is meaninglessly conventional. Similarity the various rather daring postures of
some of these Spanish dances probably have become so conventionalized by
numberless repetitions along the formal requirements of the dance that their
possible significance has been long since forgotten. The apparently deliberate
luring of the man by the woman exists solely in the mind of some such alien
spectator as myself. I was philosophical enough to say these things to myself;
but Johnny was not. He saw Mercedes languishing into the eyes of his rival; half
fleeing provocatively, her glances sparkling; bending and swaying her body in
allurement; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span> finally
in the finale of the dance, melting into her partner&#8217;s arms as though in
surrender. He could not realize that these were formal and established measures
for a dance. He was too blind to see that the partners separated quite calmly
and sauntered nonchalantly toward the veranda, the man rolling a paper cigarro,
the woman flirting idly her fan. His eyes glowing dully, he stared straight
before him; a spot of colour mounted on his cheekbones.</p>

<p>With an exclamation Talbot Ward arose swiftly but quietly and moved down the
veranda, motioning me to follow. He bent over Johnny&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to you a moment,&#8221; he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Johnny looked up at him a moment defiantly. Talbot stood above him,
inflexibly waiting. With a muttered exclamation Johnny finally arose from his
chair. Ward grasped his arm and drew him through the wandering natives, past the
fringe of American spectators, and down the hard moonlit path to the
village.</p>

<p>Johnny jerked his arm loose and stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir!&#8221; he demanded, his head high.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are on your way to California,&#8221; said Ward, &#8220;and you
are stopping here over one night. The girl is pretty and graceful and with much
charm, but uneducated, and quite empty headed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will thank you to leave all young ladies out of this
discussion,&#8221; broke in Johnny hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;This young lady is the whole of this discussion and cannot be left
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we will abandon the discussion.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_54'></a>54</span>&#8220;Also,&#8221; said Talbot Ward irrelevantly,
&#8220;did you notice how fat all their mothers are?&#8221;</p>

<p>We were wandering forward slowly. Again Johnny stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you, sir, that I consider my affairs none of your
business, sir; and that I resent any interference with them,&#8221; said he with
heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Johnny,&#8221; replied Talbot sadly; &#8220;I am not going
to try to advise you. Only I wanted to call your attention to all the elements
of the situation, which you probably had forgotten. I will repeat&#8211;and then
I am done&#8211;she is nothing to you, she is beneath you, you are stopping here
but one day, she is charming but ignorant&#8211;and her mother is very fat. Now
go have your fool fight&#8211;for that is what you are headed straight
for&#8211;if you think it at all worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s generous heart must have been smiting him sorely, now that his
heat and excitement had had time to cool a little. He followed us a few steps
irresolutely. We came to the large tree by the wayside. The man with the fever
still sat there miserably indifferent to his surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, this won&#8217;t do!&#8221; cried Talbot. &#8220;He
mustn&#8217;t be allowed to sit there all night; he&#8217;ll catch a chill sure.
My friend, give us your arm. We&#8217;ll find you some sort of a
bunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was dead.</p>

<p>We carried him to the village and raised a number of our compatriots. Not one
knew who the man might be, nor even where his belongings had been stored. He had
no mark of identification on his person. After a diligent <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span> search, we were forced to give it up. The
body we buried with all reverence at the edge of the jungle. I wanted to place
the matter on an official footing by notifying the <i>alcalde</i>, but Talbot
negatived this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know this people,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Once let the news of a
man&#8217;s death get abroad, and it&#8217;s good-bye to any chance of finding
his effects to-morrow. And that&#8217;s our only show to identify him. Best say
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>We returned slowly to the <i>alcalde&#8217;s</i> house. The fandango was
still in progress. Mercedes flashed her bright eyes at Johnny as we mounted the
steps; the Spaniard scowled and muttered an imprecation. Johnny bowed gravely
and passed into the house.</p>

<p>We told Yank the circumstances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor devil,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Like the rest of us, he was so full
of hope so short time ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ward nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And his death was so unnecessary, so utterly and completely
useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; spoke up Talbot musingly. &#8220;It seems
to us unnecessary, but who can tell? And useless? I don&#8217;t know. If we
hadn&#8217;t happened to stumble on that poor chap just then, Johnny Fairfax
might be in his fix right this minute, and Johnny Fairfax seems to me likely to
prove a very valuable citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did the blame critter mean by that?&#8221; Yank asked me
later.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TRAIL</span></h2>

<p>We made desperate efforts next morning to find somebody who knew the man, or
at least could point out to us his effects; but in vain. All was confusion, and
everybody was too busy getting away to pay us very much attention. This, I am
convinced, was not hardheartedness on the part of most; but merely that all
men&#8217;s minds were filled with a great desire. Our own transport men were
impatient to be off; and we had finally to abandon the matter. Whether or not
the man had a family or friends who would never know what had become of him, we
shall never find out. Later in the gold rush there were many scores of such
cases.</p>

<p>Having paid the <i>alcalde</i> we set forth. Mercedes did not appear. Our
good <i>padrone</i> was on hand to say farewell to us at the edge of town. He
gave us a sort of cup made from coconut husk to which long cords had been
attached. With these, he explained, we could dip up water without dismounting.
We found them most convenient.</p>

<p>Shortly after we had left town, and before we had really begun our journey in
earnest, we passed a most astonishing caravan going the other way. This
consisted of sixteen mules and donkeys under sole charge of three men armed with
antiquated and somewhat rusty muskets. On either side of each mule, slung in a
rope and plain to see, hung a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_57'></a>57</span> heavy ingot of gold! Fascinated, we approached and
stroked the satiny beautiful metal; and wondered that, on a road so crowded with
travellers of all grades, so precious a train should be freely entrusted to the
three ragged lazy natives. So curious did this seem that Talbot inquired of the
leader why it was allowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whither would a thief run to? How could he carry away these heavy
ingots?&#8221; the man propounded.</p>

<p>Often around subsequent campfires we have in idle curiosity attempted to
answer these two questions successfully, but have always failed. The gold was
safe.</p>

<p>Talbot insisted, with a good deal of heavy argument, that our effects should
precede us on the trail. The wisdom of this was apparent before we had been out
an hour. We came upon dozens of porters resting sprawled out by the side of
their loads. I could hardly blame them; for these men carried by means of a
bamboo screen and straps across the shoulders and forehead the most enormous
loads. But farther on we passed also several mule trains, for whose stopping
there could be no reason or excuse except that their natives were lazy. Our own
train we were continually overtaking and prodding on, to its intense disgust.
Thus Talbot&#8217;s forethought, or experience with people of this type, assured
us our goods. Some of our shipmates were still waiting for their baggage when we
sailed to the north.</p>

<p>We now entered a dense forest country. The lofty trees, thick foliage,
swinging vines, and strange big leaves undoubtedly would have impressed us under
other conditions. But just now we were too busy. The rains had softened the
trail, until it was of the consistency of very stiff mud. In <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span> this mud the first mule
had left his tracks. The next mule trod carefully in the first mule&#8217;s
footsteps; and all subsequent mules did likewise. The consequence was a
succession of narrow, deep holes in the clay, into which an animal&#8217;s leg
sank halfway to the shoulder. No power on earth, I firmly believe, could have
induced those mules to step anywhere else. Each hole was full of muddy water.
When the mule inserted his hoof the water spurted out violently, as though from
a squirt gun. As a result we were, I believe, the most muddied and bedraggled
crew on earth. We tried walking, but could not get on at all. Occasionally we
came to a steep little ravine down and up the slippery banks of which we slid
and scrambled. Yank and his mule once landed in a heap, plump in the middle of a
stream.</p>

<p>In the course of these tribulations we became somewhat separated. Johnny and
I found ourselves riding along in company, and much too busy to talk. As we
neared a small group of natives under a tree, three of them started toward us on
a run, shouting something. We stopped, and drew together.</p>

<p>One of the assailants seized Johnny&#8217;s animal by the bit, and
another&#8217;s gesture commanded him to dismount.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of that!&#8221; shouted Johnny threateningly; and as the men
did not obey his emphatic tone, he snatched out his Colt&#8217;s pistol. I
closed in next him and did the same.</p>

<p>Our threatening attitude caused the men to draw back a trifle; but they
redoubled their vociferations. Johnny attempted to spur his mule forward; but
all three threw themselves in his way. The rest of the natives, four in <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span> number, joined the group.
They pointed at Johnny&#8217;s animal, motioned peremptorily for him to descend;
and one of them ventured again to seize his bridle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s robbery, anyhow,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;They seem to recognize your mule. Probably you&#8217;re riding a stolen
animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about that,&#8221; said Johnny, a trifle
angrily, &#8220;but I do know I hired it to go to Panama with: and to Panama
I&#8217;m going. They can settle their mule question afterward.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when he gathered his reins again, he was prevented from going on. Johnny
reached suddenly forward and struck with his pistol barrel at the head of the
man holding his rein. He missed by the fraction of an inch; and the man leaped
back with a cry of rage. Everybody yelled and drew near as though for a rush.
Johnny and I cocked our weapons.</p>

<p>At this moment we heard Talbot Ward&#8217;s voice from beyond. &#8220;Take
&#8217;em from that side!&#8221; yelled Johnny excitedly. &#8220;Give it to
&#8217;em, Tal!&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot shouted again, in Spanish. Every brigand in the lot immediately turned
in his direction, shouting perfect fountains of words. After a moment Talbot,
afoot, emerged from the jungle and calmly picked his way through the mud toward
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put up your shooting irons,&#8221; he grinned at us. &#8220;These men
tell me your saddle pad is on crooked and they want to straighten it for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny, and I am sure myself, turned red; then everybody howled with glee.
Johnny dismounted, and a dozen eager <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_60'></a>60</span> hands adjusted the harness. We shook hands all
around, laughed some more, and resumed our very sloppy journey.</p>

<p>This to me was one of the most terrible days I ever spent. We passed dozens
of dead mules, and vultures that sat in trees; and exhausted men lying flat as
though dead; and sick men shaken with fever; and one poor wretch, whom we picked
up and took with us, who had actually lain down to die. He was half raving with
fever, and as near as we could make out had had companions. We twisted him
aboard a mule, and took turns walking alongside and holding him on. Beyond the
fact that he was a very small individual with light hair and an English accent,
we could tell nothing about him. He was suffering from cholera, although we did
not know that at the time. That night we spent at a wayside hut, where we left
our patient.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we began to ascend a little; and so came to a rocky
tableland with palms, and beyond it another ridge of hills. We climbed that
ridge and descended the other side. Another elevation lay before us. This we
surmounted, only to find a third. After we had put a dozen such ranges behind
us, we made the mistake of thinking the next was sure to be the last. We got up
our hopes a number of times in this fashion, then fell dully into a despair of
ever getting anywhere. The day was fearfully hot. The Indian who had stolidly
preceded us as guide at last stopped, washed his feet carefully in a wayside mud
hole and put on his pantaloons.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks to me like an encouraging symptom,&#8221; I remarked.</p>

<p>Shortly after we entered the city of Panama.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>PANAMA</span></h2>

<p>We arrived early in the afternoon, and we were all eyes; for here was a city
taken directly from the pages of the Boy&#8217;s Own Pirate. Without the least
effort of the imagination we could see Morgan or Kidd or some other old
swashbuckler, cutlass in teeth, pistols in hand, broad sashed, fierce and
ruthless rushing over the walls or through the streets, while the cathedral
bells clanged wildly and women screamed. Everything about it was of the past;
for somehow the modern signs of American invasion seemed temporary and to be
blown away. The two-story wooden houses with corridor and veranda across the
face of the second story, painted in bright colours, leaned crazily out across
the streets toward each other. Narrow and mysterious alleys led up between them.
Ancient cathedrals and churches stood gray with age before grass-grown plazas.
And in the outskirts of town were massive masonry ruins of great buildings,
convent and colleges, some of which had never been finished. The immense blocks
lay about the ground in a confusion, covered softly by thousands of little
plants; or soared against the sky in broken arches and corridors. Vegetation and
vines grew in every crevice; and I saw many full-sized trees rooted in midair.
The place was strongly fanciful; and I loved to linger there. To me <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span> the jungle seemed like an
insidiously beautiful creature enveloping thus, little by little, its
unsuspecting prey. The old gray tumbled ruins seemed to be lost in dreams of
their ancient days. And through the arches and the empty corridors open to the
sky breathed a melancholy air from a past so dead and gone and buried and
forgotten that of it remained no echo, no recollection, no knowledge, nothing
but squared and tumbled stones.</p>

<p>To tell the truth I generally had these reflections quite to myself. The body
of the town was much more exciting. The old dilapidated and picturesque houses
had taken on a new and temporary smartness of modernity&#8211;consisting mainly
of canvas signs. The main street was of hotels, eating houses, and assorted
hells. It was crowded day and night, for we found something over a thousand men
here awaiting the chance of transportation. Some had been here a long time, and
were broke and desperate. A number of American gambling joints did a good
business. Native drinking houses abounded. The natives were in general a showy
lot, but too lazy even to do a good job at fleecing the stranger within their
gates. That was therefore undertaken&#8211;and most competently&#8211;by the
enterprising foreigners of all nations. Foreigners kept two of the three hotels,
as is indicated by their names&#8211;Hotel Française, Fonda Americano, and the
Washington House. Americans ran the gambling joints. French and Germans, mainly,
kept the restaurants.</p>

<p>We stopped over one day at the Fonda Americano; and then realizing that we
were probably in for a long wait, found two rooms in a house off the main
street. These we <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
rented from a native at a fairly reasonable rate. They were in the second story
of a massive stone ruin whose walls had been patched up with whitewash. The
rooms were bare and geometrically cat-a-cornered and extraordinarily chilly,
like vaults; but they gave out on a charmingly unkempt walled garden with a
stone fountain in the middle whose features were all rounded by time and blurred
with moss, with tall ragged bananas and taller wind-swept palms, and a creeping
lush tangle of old plants, and the damp soft greenness of moss and the elfin
tinkling of little waters. On our balcony the sun shone strong; so that we could
warm our chilled bones gratefully like lizards against a wall.</p>

<p>We tried all the restaurants, one after the other, and found them about
equally bad. We also went in&#8211;once&#8211;for a real Spanish dinner. It
consisted of a succession of dishes highly seasoned with the hottest sort of
pepper, generally drowned in rich gravy, and composed of such things as cheese,
chunks of meat, corn meal, and the like. Any one of these dishes would have been
a fine strength test for the average unsophisticated stomach; but your true
Spanish dinner consists of a dozen of them. We had horrible indigestion.</p>

<p>In one place, kept by a German, we were treated very disagreeably, and
overcharged so badly that Yank vowed he intended to get even. As to just how he
was going to do it, he maintained a deep silence; but he advised us he would eat
there the following evening. Also he asked four or five other men, with whom we
had become friendly, to meet us at the restaurant. We met, ate our meal
leisurely, and had a very good time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>&#8220;Now,&#8221;
said Yank to us, &#8220;when we get up, you fellows all go right out the front
door and keep going until you get to the Fonda bar, and there you wait for me.
No lingering, now. Do as you are told.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did as we were told. After about fifteen or twenty minutes Yank sauntered
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll explain.
We&#8217;re much obliged for your dinner party, but we want to know what it is
all about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; chuckled Yank, &#8220;I just dealt the Dutchman what you
might call idle persiflage until you fellows had been gone a few minutes, and
then I held him out my dollar. &#8216;What&#8217;s that?&#8217; says he. &#8216;That&#8217;s
a dollar,&#8217; says I, &#8216;to pay for my dinner.&#8217; &#8216;How about all those
other fellows?&#8217; says he. &#8216;I got nothing to do with them,&#8217; says I.
&#8216;They can pay for their own dinners,&#8217; and after a while I come away. He
was having some sort of Dutch fit, and I got tired of watching him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Outside the walls of the city was a large encampment of tents in which dwelt
the more impecunious or more economical of the miners. Here too had been located
a large hospital tent. There was a great deal of sickness, due to the hardships
of the journey, the bad climate, irregular living, the overeating of fruit,
drinking, the total lack of sanitation. In fact only the situation of the
city&#8211;out on an isthmus in the sea breezes&#8211;I am convinced, saved us
from pestilence. Every American seemed to possess a patent medicine of some sort
with which he dosed himself religiously in and out of season. A good many, I
should think, must have fallen victims to these nostrums.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>Each morning
regularly we went down to harass the steamship employees. Roughly speaking some
three hundred of us had bought through passage before leaving New York: and it
was announced that only fifty-two additional to those already aboard could be
squeezed into the first steamer. The other two hundred and forty-eight would
have to await the next. Naturally every man was determined that he would not be
left; for such a delay, in such a place, at the time of a gold rush was
unthinkable. The officials at that steamship office had no easy time. Each man
wanted first of all to know just when the ship was to be expected; a thing no
one could guess. Then he demanded his accommodations; and had a dozen reasons
why his claim should be preferred over that of the others. I never saw a more
quarrelsome noisy dog-kennel than that steamship office. Why no one was ever
shot there I could not tell you.</p>

<p>After bedevilling the officials for a time, our business for the day was
over. We had the privilege of sauntering through the streets, of walking down
the peninsula or of seating ourselves in any of the numerous bars or gambling
halls. All were interesting; though neither the streets nor the gambling places
were in full action until late afternoon.</p>

<p>About four o&#8217;clock, or half after, when the invariable siesta was over,
the main street began to fill with idlers. The natives wore white, with wide
soft straw hats, and lounged along with considerable grace. They were a weak,
unenergetic, inoffensive race, always ready to get off the sidewalk for other
nations provided the other nations swaggered sufficiently. The women, I
remember, had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
wonderful piles of glossy black hair, arranged in bands and puffs, in which they
stuck cigars. The streets were very narrow. When a vehicle came along, we all
had to make way for it; as also for the gangs of prisoners connected with heavy
iron chains around their necks. These were very numerous; and I can hear yet as
the leading notes of the place, the clinking of their chains, and the cracked
jangling of some of the many cathedral bells.</p>

<p>There was a never-failing joy to us also in poking around the odd places of
the town. The dim interiors of cathedrals, the splashed stones of courtyards,
the shadows of doorways, the privacies of gardens all lured us; and we saw many
phases of native life. Generally we were looked on at first with distrust. There
were a number of roughs among the gold seekers; men whose brutal instincts or
whose merely ignorant love of horseplay had now for the first time no check.
They found that the native could be pushed off the sidewalk, so they pushed him
off. I once saw a number of these men light their cigars at altar candles. But
Talbot&#8217;s Spanish and our own demeanour soon gained us admission.</p>

<p>Thus we ran across a most delightful institution. We were rambling in a very
obscure portion of town when we came to quite a long wall unbroken save by a
little wicket gate. A bell pull seemed to invite investigation; so we gave it a
heave. Almost immediately the gate swung open and we entered.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in a wide space paved with smooth great slabs of rocks,
wet as though from a recent rain. The space was thickly built up by small round
huts of reeds, but without roofs. In the centre was a well, probably ten or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span> twelve feet wide,
over which slanted a cross arm and wheel for the drawing of water. No human
being was in sight; the gate had been unlatched by an overhead cord.</p>

<p>We shouted. In a minute or so a very irascible old woman hobbled to us from
some mysterious lurking place among the reed huts. She spoke impatiently. Talbot
questioned her; she replied briefly, then turned and hobbled off as fast as she
could go.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221; some one asked Talbot curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said,&#8221; replied Ward, &#8220;literally this: &#8216;Why don&#8217;t
you take any of them without bothering me? They are all ready.&#8217; I imagine
she must mean these bird cages; though what they are for I couldn&#8217;t tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>We investigated the nearest. It was divided into two tiny rooms each just big
enough to hold a man. In one was a three legged stool; in the other stood two
tall graceful jars of red clay, their sides bedewed with evaporation. A dipper
made from a coconut lay across the top of one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bath house!&#8221; shouted Johnny, enchanted.</p>

<p>The water in the porous earthen jars was cold. We took each a hut and poured
the icy stuff over us to our heart&#8217;s content. All except Yank. He looked
on the proceedings we thought with some scorn; and departed carrying his long
rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; shouted Johnny finally, &#8220;where&#8217;s the
towels?&#8221;</p>

<p>To this inquiry we could find no substantial answer. There were no towels.
The old woman declined to come to our yells. She was on hand, however, when we
were ready to depart, and took one American dime as payment <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span> for the three of us. This was the only
cheap thing we found in Panama. We came every day, after the hour of
siesta&#8211;with towels. Yank refused steadfastly to indulge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m having hard enough dodging to keep clear of fever&#8217;n ager
now,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to recollect what neck of
the woods I come from. It&#8217;s a fever&#8217;n ager country out there for keeps.
They can&#8217;t keep chickens there at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Johnny innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chills they get shakes all the feathers off&#8217;n &#8217;em,&#8221;
replied Yank, &#8220;and then they freeze to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the evening the main street was a blaze of light, and the byways were
cast in darkness. The crowd was all afoot, and moved restlessly to and fro from
one bar or gambling hell to another. Of the thousand or so of strangers we came
in time to recognize by sight a great many. The journey home through the dark
was perilous. We never attempted it except in company; and as Johnny seemed
fascinated with a certain game called Mexican <i>monte</i>, we often had to
endure long waits before all our party was assembled.</p>

<p>One morning our daily trip to the steamship office bore fruit. We found the
plaza filled with excited men; all talking and gesticulating. The much tired
officials had evolved a scheme, beautiful in its simplicity, for deciding which
fifty-two of the three hundred should go by the first ship. They announced that
at eleven o&#8217;clock they would draw lots.</p>

<p>This was all very well, but how did the general public know that the lots
would be drawn fairly?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>The officials
would permit a committee of citizens to be present.</p>

<p>Not by the eternal! Where would you get any one to serve? No member of that
committee would dare accept his own ticket, provided he drew one. No one would
believe it had been done honestly.</p>

<p>Very well. Then let fifty-two out of three hundred slips of paper be marked.
Each prospective passenger could then draw one slip out of a box.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, boys,&#8221; the observers yelled back at those
clamouring in the rear.</p>

<p>One of the officials stood on a barrel holding the box, while a clerk with a
list of names sat below.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I call the names, will each gentleman step forward and draw his
slip?&#8221; announced the official.</p>

<p>We were all watching with our mouths open intensely interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of such a damfool way of doing the thing?&#8221;
said Talbot. &#8220;Here, give me a boost up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny and I raised him on our shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen! gentlemen!&#8221; he cried a number of times before he
could be heard above the row. Finally they gave him attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a ticket holder in this thing; and I want to see it done
right. I want to ask that gentleman there what is to prevent the wrong man from
answering to a name, from drawing a slip without having any right to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The right man will prevent him,&#8221; answered a voice. The crowd
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who&#8217;s to decide, in case of dispute, which is the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span> right man and which the
wrong man? And what&#8217;s to prevent any man, after the drawing, from marking
a blank slip&#8211;or making a new slip entirely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; &#8220;Correct!&#8221; shouted several
voices.</p>

<p>The officials consulted hurriedly. Then one of them announced that the
drawing would be postponed until the following morning. Each was to bring his
steamship ticket with him. The winners in the drawing must be prepared to have
their tickets countersigned on the spot. With this understanding we
dispersed.</p>

<p>This was Talbot Ward&#8217;s first public appearance; the first occasion in
which he called himself to the attention of his fellows assembled in public
meeting. The occasion was trivial, and it is only for this reason that I mention
it. His personality at once became known, and remembered; and I recollect that
many total strangers spoke to him that evening.</p>

<p>By next morning the transportation officials had worked it out. We could not
all get into the office, so the drawing took place on the Plaza outside. As each
man&#8217;s name was called, he stepped forward, showed his ticket, and was
allowed to draw a slip from the box. If it proved to be a blank, he went away;
if he was lucky, he had his ticket <i>viséd</i> on the spot. Such a proceeding
took the greater part of the day; but the excitement remained intense. No one
thought of leaving even for the noon meal.</p>

<p>Yank drew passage on the first steamer. Talbot, Johnny, and I drew
blanks.</p>

<p>We walked down to the shore to talk over the situation.</p>

</p></div><!-- figure -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>&#8220;We ought to
have bought tickets good on this particular ship, not merely good on this
line,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter what we <i>ought</i> to have done,&#8221;
rejoined Talbot a little impatiently. &#8220;What are we <i>going</i> to do? Are
we going to wait here until the next steamer comes along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s likely to be two or three months&#8211;nobody
knows,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s in six weeks, I believe. They tell me they&#8217;ve
started regular trips on a new mail contract.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, six weeks. If we stay in this hole we&#8217;ll all be sick;
we&#8217;ll be broke; and in the meantime every ounce of gold in the country
will have been picked up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the alternative?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sailing vessel,&#8221; said Talbot briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty uncertain,&#8221; I objected. &#8220;Nobody knows
when one will get in; and when it does show up it&#8217;ll be a mad scramble to
get to her. There&#8217;s a mob waiting to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s one or the other. We can&#8217;t walk; and I
don&#8217;t see that the situation is going to be much better when the next
steamer does get here. There are a couple of hundred to crowd in on
her&#8211;just counting those who are here and have tickets. And then there will
be a lot more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m for the sailing vessel,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;They come
in every week or two now; and if we can&#8217;t make the first one, we&#8217;ll
have a good chance at the second or the third.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot looked at me inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds reasonable,&#8221; I admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ve no time to lose,&#8221; said Talbot decisively, and
turned away toward the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>Yank, who had
listened silently to our brief discussion, shifted his rifle to his shoulder and
followed. Shortly he fell behind; and we lost him.</p>

<p>We accompanied Talbot in some bewilderment, for there was no ship in sight
nor in prospect, and we could not understand any reason for this haste. Talbot
led the way directly to the steamship office.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see Brown,&#8221; he asserted, naming the chief agent for
the company.</p>

<p>The clerk hesitated: Brown was an important man and not to be disturbed for
trivial matters. But Talbot&#8217;s eye could be very assured.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your business with Mr. Brown?&#8221; asked the clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is with Mr. Brown,&#8221; said Talbot firmly, &#8220;and I may add
that it is to Mr. Brown&#8217;s own interest to see me. Tell him just that, and
that Mr. Talbot Ward of New York City desires an immediate interview.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clerk was gone for some moments, to the manifest annoyance of a dozen
miners who wanted his attention. When he returned he motioned us to a
screened-off private office in the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brown will see you,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>We found Brown to be a florid, solidly built man of fifty, with a keen eye
and a brown beard. He nodded to us briefly and looked expectant.</p>

<p>&#8220;We three men,&#8221; said Talbot directly, &#8220;hold three tickets
on your line. We were not fortunate enough to get passage on the next steamer,
and our business will not permit us to wait until the one after. We want our
money back.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>Brown&#8217;s face
darkened.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a matter for my clerks, not for me,&#8221; he said curtly.
&#8220;I was told your business was to my advantage. I have nothing to do with
tickets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One minute,&#8221; said Talbot. &#8220;There are between two and three
hundred men in this town each one of whom bought a ticket from your company in
New York in the expectation, if not under the understanding, that they were to
get through passage immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such thing was expected or guaranteed,&#8221; interposed Brown
abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not guaranteed, nor expected by you&#8211;by us, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot argue that matter. I have no further time for you.
Good-day.&#8221; And Brown once more reached his hand toward his bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Talbot softly, leaning forward. &#8220;I should
put it into the heads of those three hundred men that they ought to get their
passage money back?&#8221;</p>

<p>Brown&#8217;s hand stopped in midair.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are large, violent, armed men; and they are far from pure home
influences,&#8221; went on Talbot mockingly. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a sample of
them,&#8221; said he indicating my huge frame. &#8220;And there are a thousand
or so more, not directly interested but dying for excitement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you trying to intimidate me, sir?&#8221; demanded Brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am just stating conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are threatening me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is different,&#8221; said Talbot Ward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>Brown sat lost in
thought for some moments. Then he reached forward and at last struck the
bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have your tickets,&#8221; he commanded us shortly.</p>

<p>He endorsed them and handed them to the clerk, together with a written order.
We all sat in absolute silence for perhaps five minutes. Then the clerk returned
with a handful of gold. This Brown counted over and shoved across to Talbot. The
latter also counted it, and thrust it in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Brown, with something approaching geniality, &#8220;I
am counting on your honour to say nothing of this outside. I am gambling on your
evident class in life at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have our promise, and it will be kept,&#8221; said Talbot rising.
&#8220;But undoubtedly within two days you will think I am the biggest liar
unhung. There will be many more who will think of this same simple plan of
getting a refund on their tickets and who will blab it out to every one on the
street. You would do well to make your plans now as to how you intend to deal
with them. But remember, I, nor my friends, will have had nothing to do with
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that there will be plenty making your same demand,&#8221;
said Brown, &#8220;but I doubt any of them will think of urging that
demand.&#8221;</p>

<p>We left. As a matter of interest, Talbot&#8217;s prediction was correct; as,
indeed, Brown had immediately recognized it would be. Talbot had only the
advantage of thinking a little quicker than the next man, of acting immediately,
and of allowing no time for reflection to the other. The steamship office had a
strenuous time. Talbot&#8217;s threat had this <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_75'></a>75</span> much of real significance: that there was, lacking
him, no organized demonstration. Each man went for himself and demanded his
money back. In a few rare cases he got it; but was generally bluffed out, or
blandly referred back to the New York offices, or reasoned out. The situation
came near to riot, but in some difficult manner it was tided over. A few settled
down to wait for the next steamer. The majority decided for sailing ships, and
pocketed their steamer tickets in hopes of future reimbursement. One score of
fanatics and ignoramuses, in dense ignorance as to the nature of the journey,
actually started out to row to San Francisco in an open boat! They were never
heard of again. One or two parties modified this plan by proceeding in fishing
boats to the extremity of the peninsula of Lower California, and thence marched
overland to San Diego. Their sufferings in that arid region were great, but they
managed to arrive many months later.</p>

<p>We returned to our lodgings, congratulating Talbot on the promptitude of his
action, for already we saw determined looking men hurrying across the plaza
toward the offices.</p>

<p>At our place we found that Yank had not returned. At first we thought nothing
of this; but about dusk we found that all his belongings had disappeared.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>NORTHWARD HO!</span></h2>

<p>We could not understand this sudden departure, except on the possible ground
that Yank, realizing that now the party must split forces, had decided to seek
new companions among those lucky enough to sail on the first steamer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even then he needn&#8217;t have been in such a hurry,&#8221;
complained Johnny a trifle bitterly. &#8220;And he needn&#8217;t have thought
we&#8217;d be in his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he paid his share of the lodgings?&#8221; it occurred to me to
ask.</p>

<p>We felt quite bitter against Yank, and we carefully avoided his usual haunts,
for we did not want to meet him. Then we began to think it strange we had not
run across him somewhere on the streets. Then we began to look for him. We found
that Yank had disappeared!</p>

<p>At that, a little alarmed, we set ourselves to a serious search and inquiry.
A few remembered to have seen him, but were vague as to when and where. The
authorities moved sluggishly, and with little enthusiasm. Men were dying every
day; and disappearing underground, leaving no trace of themselves behind. One
more or less seemed unimportant.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile we spent much of our time by the shore, together with a
comfortable majority of our fellow argonauts, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_77'></a>77</span> awaiting the sighting of a vessel. We had engaged,
and paid daily, a boatman to be in readiness to take us off; and we settled our
lodgings account a week ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a scramble for that blessed ship,&#8221;
said Talbot; &#8220;and we&#8217;ll just be prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>To that end we also kept our effects packed and ready for instant
removal.</p>

<p>The beach was not a bad place. It ran out the peninsula in a long gentle
curve; and the surges broke snow white on yellow sands. Across deep blue water
was an island; and back of us palm trees whipped in the trade winds. We sat
under them, and yarned and played cards and smoked. In bad weather&#8211;and it
rained pretty often&#8211;we huddled in smoky little huts; those of us who could
get in. The rest tried to stick it out; or returned with rather a relieved air
to the town.</p>

<p>The expected ship came, of course, on one of these dull gray days; and those
who had thought themselves unlucky in being crowded out of the huts were the
first to sight her. They sneaked down very quietly and tried to launch two of
the boats. Of course the native boatmen were all inside; trust them! As a high
surf was running, and as none of the men were in any sense good boatmen, they
promptly broached to and filled. The noise brought us to the door.</p>

<p>Then there was a fine row. One of the two boats commandeered by the early
birds happened to be ours! All our forethought seemed to have been in vain. The
bedraggled and crestfallen men were just wading ashore when we descended upon
them. Talbot was like a raving lunatic.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hounds!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare try to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span> sneak off! You catch hold
here and help empty these boats! You would, would you?&#8221; He caught one
escaping worthy by the collar and jerked him so rapidly backward that his heels
fairly cracked together. Johnny flew to combat with a chuckle of joy. I
contented myself by knocking two of them together until they promised to be
good. The four we had collared were very meek. We all waded into the wash where
the boat lay sluggishly rolling. It is no easy matter to empty a boat in that
condition. Water weighs a great deal; is fearfully inert, or at least feels so;
and has a bad habit of promptly slopping in again. We tugged and heaved, and
rolled and hauled until our joints cracked; but at last we got her free.</p>

<p>In the meantime forty other boats had been launched and were flying over the
waves halfway between the shore and the ship.</p>

<p>Talbot was swearing steadily and with accuracy; Johnny was working like a
crazy man; I was heaving away at the stern and keeping an eye on our involuntary
helpers. The boatman, beside himself with frantic excitement, jabbered and ran
about and screamed directions that no one understood. About all we were
accomplishing now was the keeping of that boat&#8217;s head straight against the
heavy wash.</p>

<p>It seemed as though we tugged thus at cross purposes for an hour. In reality
it was probably not over two or three minutes. Then Talbot regained sufficient
control to listen to the boatman. At once he calmed down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boys,&#8221; said he, &#8220;ease her backward. You, Johnny,
stand by at the bow and hold her head on. Frank and I will give her a shove at
the stern. When the time <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_79'></a>79</span> comes, I&#8217;ll yell and you pile right in, Johnny.
<i>Vamos</i>, Manuel!&#8221;</p>

<p>We took our places; the boatman at the oars, his eyes over his shoulder
watching keenly the in-racing seas.</p>

<p>The four dripping culprits looked at each other uncertainly, and one of them
started to climb in the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for <i>God&#8217;s</i> sake!&#8221; screeched Talbot, and made a
headlong bull rush for the man.</p>

<p>The latter tumbled right out of the boat on his back in the shallow water.
His three companions fled incontinently up the beach, where he followed them as
soon as he could scramble to his feet.</p>

<p>Manuel said something sharply, without looking around.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shove!&#8221; screeched Talbot. &#8220;Pile in, Johnny!&#8221;</p>

<p>We bent our backs, The boat resisted, yielded, gathered headway. It seemed to
be slipping away from me down a steep hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump in!&#8221; yelled Talbot.</p>

<p>I gave a mighty heave and fell over the stern into the bottom of the boat.
Waters seemed to be crashing by; but by the time I had gathered myself together
and risen to my knees, we were outside the line of breakers, and dancing like a
gull over the smooth broad surges.</p>

<p>Ships could anchor no nearer than about a mile and a half offshore. By the
time we had reached the craft she was surrounded by little boats bobbing and
rubbing against her sides. She proved to be one of that very tubby, bluff-bowed
type then so commonly in use as whalers and freighters. The decks swarmed black
with an excited crowd.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>We rowed slowly
around her. We were wet, and beginning to chill. No way seemed to offer by which
we could reach her decks save by difficult clambering, for the gang ladder was
surrounded ten deep by empty boats. A profound discouragement succeeded the
excitement under which we had made our effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with her!&#8221; snarled Johnny, &#8220;There&#8217;s no sense
going aboard her. There&#8217;s enough on deck now to fill her three times over.
Let&#8217;s get back where it&#8217;s warm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I run across any of those fellows in town I&#8217;ll break their
necks!&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes me mad&#x2500;&#8221; continued Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, for heaven&#8217;s sake shut up!&#8221; cried Talbot.</p>

<p>If he had been a little less cold and miserable we probably would have
quarrelled. As it was, we merely humped over, and motioned the astonished Manuel
to return to the shore. Our boat&#8217;s head turned, we dropped down under the
bow of the ship. In order to avoid the sweep of the seas Manuel held us as
closely as possible under the bowsprit. We heard a hail above us. Looking up we
saw Yank bending over the rail.</p>

<p>We stared at him, our mouths open, so astonished that for a moment we did not
even think to check the boat. Then we came back in a clumsy circle. Yank yelled
at us; and we yelled back at him; but so great was the crash of waters and the
whistling of wind that we could make out nothing. Then Yank motioning us to
remain where we were, disappeared, to return after a short interval, with a
speaking trumpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got your baggage with you?&#8221; he roared.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>We shook our heads
and waved our arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go get it!&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>We screamed something back at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go get it!&#8221; he repeated; and withdrew his head entirely.</p>

<p>We rowed back to town; it was no longer necessary to return to the exposed
beach where we had waited to sight the ships. Johnny and I indulged in much
excited speculation, but Talbot refused to show curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s there, and he&#8217;s evidently engaged us passage; and he
wants us aboard to claim it,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and that&#8217;s all we can
know now; and that&#8217;s enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>On our way we met a whole fleet of boats racing their belated way from town.
We grinned sardonically over the plight of these worthies. A half-hour sufficed
us to change our clothes, collect our effects, and return to the water front. On
the return journey we crossed the same fleet of boats inward bound. Their
occupants looked generally very depressed.</p>

<p>Yank met us at the top of the gangway, and assisted us in getting our baggage
aboard. Johnny and I peppered him with questions, to which he vouchsafed no
answer. When we had paid off the boatman, he led the way down a hatch into a
very dark hole near the bows. A dim lantern swayed to and fro, through the murk
we could make out a dozen bunks.</p>

<p>&#8220;They call this the fo&#8217;cas&#8217;le,&#8221; said Yank placidly. &#8220;Crew
sleeps here. This is our happy home. Everything else full up. We four,&#8221;
said he, with a little flash of triumph, &#8220;are just about the only galoots
of the whole b&#8217;iling at Panama that gets passage. She&#8217;s loaded to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span> muzzle with men
that&#8217;s come away around the Horn in her; and the only reason she stopped
in here at all is to get a new thing-um-a-jig of some sort that she had lost or
busted or something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t like my happy home while she wobbles so,&#8221;
said Johnny. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be seasick, as usual. But for
heaven&#8217;s sake, Yank, tell us where you came from, and all about it. And
make it brief, for I&#8217;m going to be seasick pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay down in one of the bunks and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d much better come up on deck into the fresh air,&#8221;
said Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire ahead, Yank! Please!&#8221; begged Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Yank, &#8220;when I drew that steamer ticket, it
struck me that somebody might want it a lot more than I did, especially as you
fellows drew blank. So I hunted up a man who was in a hurry, and sold it to him
for five hundred dollars. Then I hired one of these sail-rigged fishing boats
and laid in grub for a week and went cruising out to sea five or six
miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny opened one eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he demanded feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was figgerin&#8217; on meeting any old ship that came along a little
before the crowd got at her,&#8221; said Yank. &#8220;And judgin&#8217; by the
gang&#8217;s remarks that just left, I should think I&#8217;d figgered just
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet you did,&#8221; put in Talbot emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been mighty uncomfortable cruising out there in that
little boat so long,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I wonder the men would
stick.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>&#8220;I paid them
and they had to,&#8221; said Yank grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you let us in on it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What for? It was only a one-man job. So then I struck this ship, and
got aboard her after a little trouble persuading her to stop. There wasn&#8217;t
no way of making that captain believe we&#8217;d sleep anywheres we could except
cash; so I had to pay him a good deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; demanded Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;It came to two hundred apiece. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; shouted Talbot, &#8220;we&#8217;re ahead of the game.
Yank, you long-headed old pirate, let me shake you by the hand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you fellows would go away,&#8221; begged Johnny.</p>

<p>We went on deck. The dusk was falling, and the wind with it; and to westward
an untold wealth of gold was piling up. Our ship rolled at her anchor, awaiting
the return of those of her people who had gone ashore. On the beach tiny spots
of lights twinkled where some one had built fires. A warmth was stealing out
from the shore over the troubled waters. Talbot leaned on the rail by my side.
Suddenly he chuckled explosively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking,&#8221; said he in explanation, &#8220;of us
damfools roosting on that beach in the rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus at last we escaped from the Isthmus. At the end of twenty-four hours we
had left the island of Tobago astern, and were reaching to the north.</p>

<p class='tp' style='font-size:1.4em;'>THE GOLDEN CITY</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GOLDEN CITY</span></h2>

<p>We stood in between the hills that guarded the bay of San Francisco about ten
o&#8217;clock of an early spring day. A fresh cold wind pursued us; and the sky
above us was bluer than I had ever seen it before, even on the Isthmus. To our
right some great rocks were covered with seals and sea lions, and back of them
were hills of yellow sand. A beautiful great mountain rose green to our left,
and the water beneath us swirled and eddied in numerous whirlpools made by the
tide.</p>

<p>Everybody was on deck and close to the rail. We strained our eyes ahead; and
saw two islands, and beyond a shore of green hills. None of us knew where San
Francisco was located, nor could we find out. The ship&#8217;s company were much
too busy to pay attention to our questions. The great opening out of the bay
beyond the long narrows was therefore a surprise to us; it seemed as vast as an
inland sea. We hauled to the wind, turning sharp to the south, glided past the
bold point of rocks.</p>

<p>Then we saw the city concealed in a bend of the cove. It was mainly of
canvas; hundreds, perhaps thousands of tents and canvas houses scattered about
the sides of hills. The flat was covered with them, too, and they extended for
some distance along the shore of the cove. A great dust, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span> borne by the wind that had brought us in,
swept across the city like a cloud of smoke. Hundreds and hundreds of vessels
lay at anchor in the harbour, a vast fleet.</p>

<p>We were immediately surrounded by small boats, and our decks filled with men.
We had our first sight of the genuine miners. They proved to be as various as
the points of the compass. Big men, little men, clean men, dirty men, shaggy
men, shaven men, but all instinct with an eager life and energy I have never
seen equalled. Most wore the regulation dress&#8211;a red shirt, pantaloons
tucked into the tops of boots, broad belts with sometimes silver buckles, silk
Chinese sashes of vivid raw colours, a revolver, a bowie knife, a floppy old
hat. Occasionally one, more dignified than the rest, sported a shiny top hat;
but always with the red shirt. These were merchants, and men permanently
established in the town.</p>

<p>They addressed us eagerly, asking a thousand questions concerning the news of
the outside world. We could hardly answer them in our desire to question in
return. Were the gold stories really true? Were the diggings very far away? Were
the diggings holding out? What were the chances for newcomers? And so on without
end; and the burden always of gold! gold! gold!</p>

<p>We were answered with the enthusiasm of an old-timer welcoming a newcomer to
any country. Gold! Plenty of it! They told us, in breathless snatches, the most
marvellous tales&#8211;one sailor had dug $17,000 in a week; another man, a
farmer from New England, was taking out $5,000 to $6,000 daily. They mentioned
names and places. They pointed to the harbour full of shipping. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span> &#8220;Four hundred
ships,&#8221; said they, &#8220;and hardly a dozen men aboard the lot! All gone
to the mines!&#8221; And one man snatching a long narrow buckskin bag from his
pocket, shook out of its mouth to the palm of his hand a tiny cascade of
glittering yellow particles&#8211;the Dust! We shoved and pushed, crowding
around him to see this marvellous sight. He laughed in a sort of excited
triumph, and tossed the stuff into the air. The breeze caught it and scattered
it wide. A number of the little glittering particles clung to my rough coat,
where they flashed like spangles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty more where that came from!&#8221; cried the man; and turned
away with a reckless laugh.</p>

<p>Filled with the wine of this new excitement we finally succeeded in getting
ashore in one of the ship&#8217;s boats.</p>

<p>We landed on a flat beach of deep black sand. It was strewn from one end to
the other by the most extraordinary wreckage. There were levers, cogwheels,
cranks, fans, twisted bar, and angle iron, in all stages of rust and
disintegration. Some of these machines were half buried in the sand; others were
tidily laid up on stones as though just landed. They were of copper, iron, zinc,
brass, tin, wood. We recognized the genus at a glance. They were, one and all,
patent labour-saving gold washing machines, of which we had seen so many samples
aboard ship. At this sight vanished the last remains of the envy I had ever felt
for the owners of similar contraptions.</p>

<p>We looked about for some sort of conveyance into which to dump our
belongings. Apparently none existed. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_90'></a>90</span> Therefore we piled most of our effects neatly above
high tide, shouldered our bundles, and started off up the single street.</p>

<p>On either side this thoroughfare stood hundreds of open sheds and buildings
in the course of construction. Goods of all sorts, and in great quantity, lay
beneath them, wholly or partially exposed to the dust and weather. Many unopened
bales had been left in the open air. One low brick building of a single story
seemed to be the only substantial structure in sight. We saw quantities of
calicos, silks, rich furniture, stacks of the pieces of knock-down houses,
tierces of tobacco, piles of all sorts of fancy clothing. The most unexpected
and incongruous items of luxury seemed to have been dumped down here from the
corners of the earth, by the four hundred ships swinging idly at anchor in the
bay.</p>

<p>The street was, I think, the worst I have ever seen anywhere. It was a morass
of mud, sticky greasy mud, of some consistency, but full of water-holes and
rivulets. It looked ten feet deep; and I should certainly have ventured out on
it with misgivings. And yet, incongruously enough, the surface ridges of it had
dried, and were lifting into the air in the form of dust! This was of course my
first experience with that common California phenomenon, and I was greatly
astonished.</p>

<p>An attempt had been made to supply footing for pedestrians. Bags of sand had
been thrown down, some rocks, a very few boxes and boards. Then our feet struck
something soft and yielding, and we found we were walking over hundred pound
sacks of flour marked as from Chili. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_91'></a>91</span> There must have been many hundred of them. A man
going in the opposite direction sidled past us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheaper than lumber,&#8221; said he briefly, seeing our
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to ask the price of lumber,&#8221; remarked one of our
ship&#8217;s companions, with whom&#8211;and a number of others&#8211;we were
penetrating the town. This man carried only a very neat black morocco satchel
and a net bag containing a half dozen pineapples, the last of a number he had
brought from the Isthmus. The contrast of that morocco bag with the rest of him
was quite as amusing as any we saw about us; though, of course, he did not
appreciate that.</p>

<p>We walked on flour for a hundred feet or so, and then came to cook stoves. I
mean it. A battalion of heavy iron cook stoves had been laid side by side to
form a causeway. Their weight combined with the traffic over them had gradually
pressed them down into the mud until their tops were nearly level with the
surface. Naturally the first merry and drunken joker had shied the lids into
space. The pedestrian had now either to step in and out of fire boxes or try his
skill on narrow ledges! Next we came to a double row of boxes of tobacco; then
to some baled goods, and so off onto solid ground.</p>

<p>We passed many people, all very intent on getting along safely. From the
security of the shed stores the proprietors and an assorted lot of loafers
watched proceedings with interest. The task of crossing the street from one side
to the other, especially, was one not lightly to be undertaken! A man had to
balance, to leap, to poise; and at last probably, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span> to teeter back and forth trying to keep
his balance like a small boy on a fence rail, until, with an oath of disgust, he
stepped off into the slime.</p>

<p>When we had gained the dry ground near the head of the street we threw down
our burdens for a rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you ten dollars for those pineapples!&#8221; offered a
passerby, stopping short.</p>

<p>Our companion quickly closed the bargain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of that?&#8221; he demanded of us wide-eyed, and in
the hearing of the purchaser.</p>

<p>The latter grinned a little, and hailed a man across the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charley!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;Come over here!&#8221;</p>

<p>The individual addressed offered some demur, but finally picked his way
across to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like these?&#8221; demanded the pineapple purchaser,
showing his fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerusalem!&#8221; cried Charley admiringly, &#8220;where did you get
them? Want to sell &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want some myself, but I&#8217;ll sell you three of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first purchaser grinned openly at our companion.</p>

<p>The latter followed into the nearest store to get his share of the dust
weighed out. His face wore a very thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>We came shortly to the Plaza, since called Portsmouth Square. At that time it
was a wind-swept, grass-grown, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_93'></a>93</span> scrubby enough plot of ground. On all sides were
permanent buildings. The most important of these were a low picturesque house of
the sun-dried bricks known as adobes, in which, as it proved, the customs were
levied; a frame two-story structure known as the Parker House, and a similar
building labelled &#8220;City Hotel.&#8221; The spaces between these larger
edifices was occupied by a dozen or so of smaller shacks. Next door to the
Parker House stood a huge flapping tent. The words <i>El Dorado</i> were painted
on its side.</p>

<p>The square itself was crowded with people moving to and fro. The solid
majority of the crowd consisted of red or blue shirted miners; but a great many
nations and frames of minds seemed to be represented. Chinese merchants, with
red coral buttons atop their stiff little skullcaps, wandered slowly, their
hands tucked in capacious sleeves of the richest brocade. We had seen few of
this race; and we looked at them with the greatest interest, examining closely
their broad bland faces, the delicate lilacs and purples and blues of their rich
costumes, the swaying silk braided queues down their backs. Other Chinese, of
the lower castes, clad in blue canvas with broad bowl-shaped hats of straw on
their heads, wormed their way through the crowd balancing baskets at the ends of
poles. Rivalling the great Chinese merchants in their leisure, strolled the
representatives of the native race, the Spanish Californians. They were darkly
handsome men, dressed gloriously in short velvet jackets, snowy ruffles, plush
trousers flaring at the bottom, and slit up the side of the leg, soft leather
boots, and huge spurs ornamented with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_94'></a>94</span> silver. They sauntered to and fro smoking brown-paper
cigarettos. Beside these two, the Chinese and the Californians, but one other
class seemed to be moving with any deliberation. These were men seen generally
alone, or at most in pairs. They were quiet, waxy pale, dressed always neatly in
soft black hat, white shirt, long black coat, and varnished boots. In the face
of a general gabble they seemed to remain indifferently silent, self-contained
and aloof. To occasional salutations they responded briefly and with
gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professional gamblers,&#8221; said Talbot.</p>

<p>All the rest of the crowd rushed here and there at a great speed. We saw the
wildest incongruities of demeanour and costume beside which the
silk-hat-red-shirted combination was nothing. They struck us open-mouthed and
gasping; but seemed to attract not the slightest attention from anybody else. We
encountered a number of men dressed alike in suits of the finest broadcloth, the
coats of which were lined with red silk, and the vests of embroidered white.
These men walked with a sort of arrogant importance. We later found that they
were members of that dreaded organization known as <i>The Hounds</i>, whose
ostensible purpose was to perform volunteer police duty, but whose real effort
was toward the increase of their own power. These people all surged back and
forth good-naturedly, and shouted at each other, and disappeared with great
importance up the side streets, or darted out with equal busyness from all
points of the compass. Every few minutes a cry of warning would go up on one
side of the square or another. The crowd would scatter to right and left, and
down through the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
opening would thunder a horseman distributing clouds of dust and showers of
earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t somebody kill a few of those crazy fools!&#8221;
muttered Talbot impatiently, after a particularly close shave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you see, they&#8217;s mostly drunk,&#8221; stated a bystander
with an air of explaining all.</p>

<p>We tacked across to the doors of the Parker House. There after some search
was made we found the proprietor. He, too, seemed very busy, but he spared time
to trudge ahead of us up two rickety flights of raw wooden stairs to a loft
where he indicated four canvas bunks on which lay as many coarse blue
blankets.</p>

<p>Perhaps a hundred similar bunks occupied every available inch in the little
loft.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long you going to stay?&#8221; he asked us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know; a few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, six dollars apiece, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For how long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; expostulated Talbot. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stand that
especially for these accommodations. At that price we ought to have something
better. Haven&#8217;t you anything in the second story?&#8221;</p>

<p>The proprietor&#8217;s busy air fell from him; and he sat down on the edge of
one of the canvas bunks.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you boys were from the mines,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Your
friend, here, fooled me.&#8221; He pointed his thumb at Yank. &#8220;He looks
like an old-timer. But now I look at you, I see you&#8217;re greenhorns. Just
get here to-day? Have a smoke?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>He produced a
handful of cigars, of which he lit one.</p>

<p>&#8220;We just arrived,&#8221; said Talbot, somewhat amused at this change.
&#8220;How about that second story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to tell you boys a few things,&#8221; said the proprietor,
&#8220;I get sixty thousand dollars a year rent for that second story just as
she stands. That tent next door belongs to my brother-in-law. It is just fifteen
by twenty-five feet, and he rents it for forty thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gamblers?&#8221; inquired Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve guessed it. So you see I ain&#8217;t got any beds to
speak of down there. In fact, here&#8217;s the whole layout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t stand six dollars a night for these things,&#8221;
expostulated Johnny. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try over at the other place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try ahead, boys,&#8221; said the proprietor quite good-naturedly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find her the same over there; and everywhere else.&#8221; He
arose. &#8220;Best leave your plunder here until you find out. Come down and
have a drink?&#8221;</p>

<p>We found the City Hotel offered exactly the same conditions as did the Parker
House; except that the proprietor was curt and had no time for us at all. From
that point, still dissatisfied, we extended our investigations beyond the Plaza.
We found ourselves ankle deep in sandhills on which grew coarse grass and a sort
of sage. Crazy, ramshackle huts made of all sorts of material were perched in
all sorts of places. Hundreds of tents had been pitched, beneath which and in
front of which an extremely simple housekeeping was going on. Hunt as we might
we could find no place that looked as though it would take lodgers. Most of even
the better looking houses were simply tiny skeletons covered with paper, cloth
or paint. By painstaking <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_97'></a>97</span> persistence we kept at it until we had enquired of
every building of any pretensions. Then, somewhat discouraged, we picked our way
back to the shore after our heavier goods.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the Parker House greeted us with unabated good nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how you boys feel,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There&#8217;s lots in
your fix. You&#8217;d better stick here to-night and then get organized to camp
out, if you&#8217;re going to be here long. I suppose, though, you&#8217;re
going to the mines? Well, it&#8217;ll take you several days to make your plans
and get ready. When you get back from the mines you won&#8217;t have to think
about these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of gold?&#8221; ventured Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bushels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d be up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any better gold mine than the old Parker
House,&#8221; said he comfortably.</p>

<p>We paid him twenty-four dollars.</p>

<p>By now it was late in the afternoon. The wind had dropped, but over the hills
to seaward rolled a soft beautiful bank of fog. The sun was blotted out behind
it and a chill fell. The crowds about the Plaza thinned.</p>

<p>We economized our best at supper, but had to pay some eight dollars for the
four of us. The bill was a la carte and contained such items as grizzly steak,
antelope, elk, and wild duck and goose. Grizzly steak, I remember, cost a dollar
and a quarter. By the time we had finished, it had grown dark. The lamps were
alight, and the crowds were beginning to gather. All the buildings and the big
tent <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span> next door were
a blaze of illumination. The sounds of music and singing came from every side. A
holiday spirit was in the air.</p>

<p>Johnny and I were crazy to be up and doing, but Talbot sternly repressed us,
and Yank agreed with his decision by an unusually emphatic nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all a lot of fun, I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but
this is business. And we&#8217;ve got to face it. Sit down here on the edge of
this veranda, and let&#8217;s talk things over. How much money have you got,
Yank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred and twenty dollars,&#8221; replied Yank promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re partners with me, Frank, so I know our assets,&#8221;
said Talbot with tact. &#8220;Johnny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hanged if I know,&#8221; replied that youth. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
quite a lot. I keep it in my pack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go find out,&#8221; advised Talbot.</p>

<p>Johnny was gone for some time. We smoked and listened to the rather blatantly
mingled strains of music, and watched the figures of men hurrying by in the
spangled darkness.</p>

<p>Johnny returned very much excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been robbed!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robbed? Is your money all gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s a little left, but&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot laughed quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Johnny, and cool off,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;If anybody
had robbed you, they&#8217;d have taken the whole kit and kaboodle. Did you come
out ahead on those <i>monte</i> games?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>Johnny blushed,
and laughed a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what you&#8217;re at, but you&#8217;re away off there. I just
played for small stakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And lost a lot of them. I sort of look-out your game. But that&#8217;s
all right. How much did the &#8216;robbers&#8217; leave you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve dollars, besides what I have in my clothes&#8211;twenty-one
dollars in all,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s pretty good. You beat Frank and me to death.
There&#8217;s our total assets,&#8221; said Talbot, and laid a ten-dollar gold
piece and a dime on his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll call that dime a curiosity,&#8221; said he, &#8220;for I
notice a quarter is the smallest coin they use out here. Now you see that
we&#8217;ve got to talk business. Frank and I haven&#8217;t got enough to live
on for one more day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s enough among us&#x2500;&#8221; began Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you already have your share of the partnership
finances,&#8221; corrected Talbot, quickly. &#8220;If we&#8217;re going to be
partners&#8211;and that&#8217;s desired and understood, I suppose?&#8221; We all
nodded emphatic agreement. &#8220;We must all put in the same amount. I move that said
amount be two hundred and twenty dollars apiece. Yank, you can loaf to-morrow;
you&#8217;ve got your share all made up. You can put in the day finding out all
about getting to the mines, and how much it costs, and what we will
need.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for the rest of us,&#8221; cried Talbot, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to
rustle up two hundred and twenty dollars each before to-morrow
evening!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; I asked blankly</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>&#8220;How
should I know? Out there&#8221; he waved his hand abroad at the flickering
lights. &#8220;There is the Golden City, challenging every man as he enters her
gates. She offers opportunity and fortune. All a man has to do is go and take
them! Accept the challenge!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only way I could take them would be to lift them off some other
fellow at the point of a gun,&#8221; said Johnny gloomily.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>I MAKE TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS</span></h2>

<p>We talked the situation over thoroughly, and then turned in, having lost our
chance to see the sights. Beneath us and in the tent next door went on a
tremendous row of talking, laughing, and singing that for a little while
prevented me from falling asleep. But the last month had done wonders for me in
that way; and shortly I dropped off.</p>

<p>Hours later I awakened, shivering with cold to find the moonlight pouring
into the room, and the bunks all occupied. My blanket had disappeared, which
accounted for my dreams of icebergs. Looking carefully over the sleeping forms I
discerned several with two blankets, and an equal number with none! At first I
felt inclined to raise a row; then thought better of it, by careful manipulation
I abstracted two good blankets from the most unprotected of of my neighbours,
wrapped them tightly about me, and so slept soundly.</p>

<p>We went downstairs and out into the sweetest of mornings. The sun was bright,
the sky clear and blue, the wind had not yet risen, balmy warmth showered down
through every particle of the air. I had felt some May days like this back on
our old farm. Somehow they were associated in my mind with Sunday morning and
the drawling, lazy clucking of hens. Only here there were no hens, and if it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span> was Sunday
morning&#8211;which it might have been&#8211;nobody knew it.</p>

<p>The majority of the citizens had not yet appeared, but a handful of the
poorer Chinese, and a sprinkling of others, crossed the Plaza. The doors of the
gambling places were all wide open to the air. Across the square a number of
small boys were throwing dust into the air. Johnny, with his usual sympathy for
children, naturally gravitated in their direction. He returned after a few
moments, his eyes wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what they are doing?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>We said politely that we did not.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are panning for gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what of it?&#8221; I asked, after a moment&#8217;s pause; since
Johnny seemed to expect some astonishment. &#8220;Boys are imitative little
monkeys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but they&#8217;re getting it,&#8221; insisted Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Talbot. &#8220;You&#8217;re crazy. Panning
gold&#8211;here in the streets. It&#8217;s absurd!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not absurd; come and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>We crossed the Plaza. Two small Americans and a Mexican youth were scooping
the surface earth into the palms of their hands and blowing it out again in a
slantwise stream. When it was all gone, they examined eagerly their hands. Four
others working in partnership had spread a small sheet. They threw their
handfuls of earth into the air, all the while fanning vigorously with their
hats. The breeze thus engendered puffed away the light dust, leaving only the
heavier pieces to fall on the canvas. Among these the urchins searched eagerly
and carefully, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
their heads close together. Every moment or so one of them would wet a
forefinger to pick up carefully a speck of something which he would then
transfer to an old buckskin sack.</p>

<p>As we approached, they looked up and nodded to Johnny in a friendly fashion.
They were eager, alert, precocious gamins, of the street type and how they had
come to California I could not tell you. Probably as cabin boys of some of the
hundreds of vessels in the harbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you getting, boys?&#8221; asked Talbot after a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold, of course,&#8221; answered one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy with the buckskin sack held it open for our inspection, but did not
relax his grip on it. The bottom of the bag was thickly gilded with light
glittering yellow particles.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like gold,&#8221; said I, incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> gold,&#8221; replied the boy with some impatience.
&#8220;Anyway, it buys things.&#8221;</p>

<p>We looked at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold diggings right in the streets of San Francisco,&#8221; murmured
Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d find it easier later in the day when the
wind came up?&#8221; suggested Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; and let some other kids jump our claim while we were
waiting,&#8221; grunted one of the busy miners.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you get out of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good days we make as high as three or four dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the diggings are hardly rich enough to tempt <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span> us,&#8221; observed
Talbot; &#8220;but isn&#8217;t that the most extraordinary performance!
I&#8217;d no notion&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>We returned slowly to the hotel, marvelling. Yesterday we had been laughing
at the gullibility of one of our fellow-travellers who had believed the tale of
a wily ship&#8217;s agent to the effect that it was possible to live aboard the
ship and do the mining within reach ashore at odd hours of daylight! Now that
tale did not sound so wild; although of course we realized that the gold must
occur in very small quantities. Otherwise somebody beside small boys would be at
it. As a matter of fact, though we did not find it out until very much later,
the soil of San Francisco is not auriferous at all. The boys were engaged in
working the morning&#8217;s sweepings from the bars and gambling houses which
the lavish and reckless handling of gold had liberally impregnated. In some of
the mining towns nearer the source of supply I have known of from one hundred to
three hundred dollars a month being thus &#8220;blown&#8221; from the sweepings
of a bar.</p>

<p>We ate a frugal breakfast and separated on the agreed business of the day.
Yank started for the water front to make inquiries as to ways of getting to the
mines; Talbot set off at a businesslike pace for the hotel as though he knew
fully what he was about; Johnny wandered rather aimlessly to the east; and I as
aimlessly to the west.</p>

<p>It took me just one hour to discover that I could get all of any kind of work
that any dozen men could do, and at wages so high that at first I had to ask
over and over again to make sure I had heard aright. Only none of them would
bring me in two hundred and twenty dollars by evening. The further I looked into
that proposition, the more absurd, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_105'></a>105</span> of course, I saw it to be. I could earn from twenty
to fifty dollars by plain day-labour at some jobs; or I could get fabulous
salaries by the month or year; but that was different. After determining this to
my satisfaction I came to the sensible conclusion that I would make what I
could.</p>

<p>The first thing that caught my eye after I had come to this decision was a
wagon drawn by four mules coming down the street at a sucking walk. The sight
did not impress me particularly; but every storekeeper came out from his shop
and every passerby stopped to look with respect as the outfit wallowed along. It
was driven by a very large, grave, blond man with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s John A. McGlynn,&#8221; said a man next my elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s he?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at me in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know who John McGlynn is?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;When
did you get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Well, John has the only American wagon in town. Brought it out
from New York in pieces, and put it together himself. Broke four wild California
mules to drag her. He&#8217;s a wonder!&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not, then, see quite how this exploit made him such a wonder; but on
a sudden inspiration I splashed out through the mud and climbed into the
wagon.</p>

<p>McGlynn looked back at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Freightin&#8217;,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is twenty dollars a ton; and
at that rate it&#8217;ll cost you about thirty dollars, you dirty hippopotamus.
These ain&#8217;t no safe-movers, these mules!&#8221;</p>

<p>Unmoved, I clambered up beside him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;I want a
job,&#8221; said I, &#8220;for to-day only.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do ye now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you give me one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can, mebbe. And do you understand the inner aspirations of mules,
maybe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was brought up on a farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the principles of elementary navigation by dead
reckoning?&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean mudholes,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Can you keep out of
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can try.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled up the team, handed me the reins, and clambered over the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hired. At six o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ll find you and pay
you off. You get twenty-five dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go to the shore and you rustle about whenever you see anything
that looks like freight; and you look at it, and when you see anything marked
with a diamond and an H inside of it, you pile it on and take it up to Howard
Mellin &amp; Company. And if you can&#8217;t lift it, then leave it for another
trip, and bullyrag those skinflints at H. M. &amp; Co.&#8217;s to send a man
down to help you. And if you don&#8217;t know where they live, find out; and if
you bog them mules down I&#8217;ll skin you alive, big as you are. And anyway,
you&#8217;re a fool to be working in this place for twenty-five dollars a day,
which is one reason I&#8217;m so glad to find you just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, John?&#8221; inquired a cool, amused voice. McGlynn
and I looked around. A tall, perfectly dressed <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_107'></a>107</span> figure stood on the sidewalk surveying us
quizzically. This was a smooth-shaven man of perhaps thirty-five years of age,
grave faced, clean cut, with an air of rather ponderous slow dignity that
nevertheless became his style very well. He was dressed in tall white hat, a
white winged collar, a black stock, a long tailed blue coat with gilt buttons,
an embroidered white waistcoat, dapper buff trousers, and varnished boots. He
carried a polished cane and wore several heavy pieces of gold jewellery&#8211;a
watch fob, a scarf-pin, and the like. His movements were leisurely, his voice
low. It seemed to me, then, that somehow the perfection of his appointments and
the calm deliberation of his movement made him more incongruous and remarkable
than did the most bizarre whims of the miners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it yourself, Judge Girvin?&#8221; replied McGlynn, &#8220;I&#8217;m
just telling this young man that he can&#8217;t have the job of driving my
little California canaries for but one day because I&#8217;ve hired a fine
lawyer from the East at two hundred and seventy-five a month to drive my mules
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done well,&#8221; Judge Girvin in his grave, courteous tones.
&#8220;For the whole business of a lawyer is to know how to manage mules and
asses so as to make them pay!&#8221;</p>

<p>I drove to the beach, and speedily charged my wagon with as large a load as
prudence advised me. The firm of Howard Mellin &amp; Company proved to have
quarters in a frame shack on what is now Montgomery Street. It was only a short
haul, but a muddy one. Nearly opposite their store a new wharf was pushing its
way out into the bay. I could see why this and other firms clung so tenaciously
to <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span> their locations
on rivers of bottomless mud in preference to moving up into the drier part of
town.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my day hugely. My eminent position on the driver&#8217;s
seat&#8211;eminent both actually and figuratively&#8211;gave me a fine
opportunity to see the sights and to enjoy the homage men seemed inclined to
accord the only wagon in town. The feel of the warm air was most grateful. Such
difficulties as offered served merely to add zest to the job. At noon I ate some
pilot bread and a can of sardines bought from my employers. About two
o&#8217;clock the wind came up from the sea, and the air filled with the
hurrying clouds of dust.</p>

<p>In my journeys back and forth I had been particularly struck by the bold,
rocky hill that shut off the view toward the north. Atop this hill had been
rigged a two-armed semaphore, which, one of the clerks told me, was used to
signal the sight of ships coming in the Golden Gate. The arms were variously
arranged according to the rig or kind of vessel. Every man, every urchin, every
Chinaman, even, knew the meaning of these various signals. A year later, I was
attending a theatrical performance in the Jenny Lind Theatre on the Plaza. In
the course of the play an actor rushed on frantically holding his arms
outstretched in a particularly wooden fashion, and uttering the lines,
&#8220;What means this, my lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sidewheel steamer!&#8221; piped up a boy&#8217;s voice from the
gallery.</p>

<p>Well, about three o&#8217;clock of this afternoon, as I was about delivering
my fifth load of goods, I happened to look up just as the semaphore arms hovered
on the rise. It <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
seemed that every man on the street must have been looking in the same
direction, for instantly a great shout went up.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sidewheel steamer! The <i>Oregon</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>At once the streets were alive with men hurrying from all directions toward
the black rocks at the foot of Telegraph Hill, where, it seems, the
steamer&#8217;s boats were expected to land. Flags were run up on all sides,
firearms were let off, a warship in the harbour broke out her bunting and fired
a salute. The decks of the steamer, as she swept into view, were black with men;
her yards were gay with colour. Uptown some devoted soul was ringing a bell; and
turning it away over and over, to judge by the sounds. I pulled up my mules and
watched the vessel swing down through the ranks of the shipping and come to
anchor. We had beaten out our comrades by a day!</p>

<p>At five o&#8217;clock a small boy boarded me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to drive the mules up to McGlynn&#8217;s and unhitch them
and leave them,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m to show you the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s McGlynn?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting his mail.&#8221;</p>

<p>We drove to a corral and three well-pitched tents down in the southern edge
of town. Here a sluggish stream lost its way in a swamp of green hummocky grass.
I turned out the mules in the corral and hung up the harness.</p>

<p>&#8220;McGlynn says you&#8217;re to go to the post-office and he&#8217;ll pay
you there,&#8221; my guide instructed me.</p>

<p>The post-office proved to be a low adobe one-story building, with the narrow
veranda typical of its kind. A <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_110'></a>110</span> line of men extended from its door and down the
street as far as the eye could reach. Some of them had brought stools or boxes,
and were comfortably reading scraps of paper.</p>

<p>I walked down the line. A dozen from the front I saw Johnny standing. This
surprised me, for I knew he could not expect mail by this steamer. Before I had
reached him he had finished talking to a stranger, and had yielded his
place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; he greeted me. &#8220;How you getting on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So-so!&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a man who owes
me twenty-five dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s here,&#8221; said Johnny confidently.
&#8220;Everybody in town is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>We found McGlynn in line about a block down the street. When he saw me coming
he pulled a fat buckskin bag from his breeches pocket, opened its mouth, and
shook a quantity of its contents, by guess, into the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are,&#8221; said he; &#8220;that&#8217;s near enough.
I&#8217;m a pretty good guesser. I hope you took care of the mules all right;
you ought to, you&#8217;re from a farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fixed &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the mud? How many times did you get stuck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me with surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you think of that, now!&#8221; said he. &#8220;You must have
loaded her light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get all the goods over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>&#8220;Well,
I&#8217;ll acknowledge you&#8217;re a judgematical young man; and if you want a
job with me I&#8217;ll let that lawyer go I spoke to the judge about. He handed
it to me then, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221; He laughed heartily. &#8220;No? Well,
you&#8217;re right. A man&#8217;s a fool to work for any one but himself.
Where&#8217;s your bag? Haven&#8217;t any? How do you carry your dust?
Haven&#8217;t any? I forgot; you&#8217;re a tenderfoot, of course.&#8221; He
opened his buckskin sack with his teeth, and poured back the gold from the palm
of his hand. Then he searched for a moment in all his pockets, and produced a
most peculiar chunk of gold metal. It was nearly as thick as it was wide, shaped
roughly into an octagon, and stamped with initials. This he handed to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about a fifty-dollar slug,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you can
get it weighed. Give me the change next time you see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I may leave for the mines to-morrow,&#8221; I objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then leave the change with Jim Recket of the El Dorado.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know I&#8217;ll leave it?&#8221; I asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied McGlynn bluntly. &#8220;But if you need
twenty-five dollars worse than you do a decent conscience, then John A. McGlynn
isn&#8217;t the man to deny you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny and I left for the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you expected any mail,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But thought I saw you in line&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. When I saw the mail sacks, it struck me that there might be
quite a crowd; so I came up as quickly as I could and got in line. There were a
number before me, but I got a place pretty well up in front. Sold the place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span> for five dollars,
and only had to stand there about an hour at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good head!&#8221; I admired. &#8220;I&#8217;d never have thought of
it. How have you gotten on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty rotten,&#8221; confessed Johnny. &#8220;I tried all morning to
find a decent opportunity to do something or deal in something, and then I got
mad and plunged in for odd jobs. I&#8217;ve been a regular errand boy. I made
two dollars carrying a man&#8217;s bag up from the ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much all told?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen. I suppose you&#8217;ve got your pile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That twenty-five you saw me get is the size of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny brightened; we moved up closer in a new intimacy and sense of
comradeship over delinquency. It relieved both to feel that the other, too, had
failed. To enter the Plaza we had to pass one of the larger of the gambling
places.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going in here,&#8221; said Johnny, suddenly.</p>

<p>He swung through the open doors, and I followed him.</p>

<p>The place was comparatively deserted, owing probably to the distribution of
mail. We had full space to look about us; and I was never more astonished in my
life. The outside of the building was rough and unfinished as a barn, having
nothing but size to attract or recommend. The interior was the height of lavish
luxury. A polished mahogany bar ran down one side, backed by huge gilt framed
mirrors before which were pyramided fine glasses and bottles of liquor. The rest
of the wall space was thickly hung with more plate mirrors, dozens of
well-executed oil paintings, and strips of tapestry. At one end was a small
raised <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span> stage on
which lolled half-dozen darkies with banjos and tambourines. The floor was
covered with a thick velvet carpet. Easy chairs, some of them leather
upholstered, stood about in every available corner. Heavy chandeliers of glass,
with hundreds of dangling crystals and prisms, hung from the ceiling. The
gambling tables, a half dozen in number, were arranged in the open floor space
in the centre. Altogether it was a most astounding contrast in its sheer luxury
and gorgeous furnishing to the crudity of the town. I became acutely conscious
of my muddy boots, my old clothes, my unkempt hair, my red shirt and the
armament strapped about my waist.</p>

<p>A relaxed, subdued air of idleness pervaded the place. The gamblers lounged
back of their tables, sleepy-eyed and listless. On tall stools their lookouts
yawned behind papers. One of these was a woman, young, pretty, most attractive
in the soft, flaring, flouncy costume of that period. A small group of men stood
at the bar. One of the barkeepers was mixing drinks, pouring the liquid, at
arm&#8217;s length from one tumbler to another in a long parabolic curve, and
without spilling a drop. Only one table was doing business, and that with only
three players. Johnny pushed rapidly toward this table, and I, a little
diffidently, followed.</p>

<p>The game was roulette. Johnny and the dealer evidently recognized each other,
for a flash of the eye passed between them, but they gave no other sign. Johnny
studied the board a moment then laid twenty-two dollars in coin on one of the
numbers. The other players laid out small bags of gold dust. The wheel spun, and
the ball rolled. Two of the men lost; their dust was emptied into a drawer
beneath <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span> the table
and the bags tossed back to them. The third had won; the dealer deftly estimated
the weight of his bet, lifting it in the flat of his left hand; then spun
several gold pieces toward the winner. He seemed quite satisfied. The gambler
stacked a roll of twenty-dollar pieces, added one to them, and thrust them at
Johnny. I had not realized that the astounding luck of winning off a single
number had befallen him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten to one&#8211;two hundred and twenty dollars!&#8221; he muttered to
me.</p>

<p>The other three players were laying their bets for the next turn of the
wheel. Johnny swept the gold pieces into his pocket, and laid back the original
stake against <i>even</i>. He lost. Thereupon he promptly arose and left the
building.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>TALBOT DESERTS</span></h2>

<p>I followed him to the hotel somewhat gloomily; for I was now the only member
of our party who had not made good the agreed amount of the partnership. It is
significant that never for a moment did either Johnny or myself doubt that
Talbot would have the required sum. Johnny, his spirits quite recovered,
whistled like a lark.</p>

<p>We arrived just in time for the first supper call, and found Talbot and Yank
awaiting us. Yank was as cool and taciturn, and nodded to us as indifferently,
as ever. Talbot, however, was full of excitement. His biscuit-brown complexion
had darkened and flushed until he was almost Spanish-black, and the little
devils in his eyes led a merry dance between the surface and unguessed depths.
He was also exceedingly voluble; and, as usual when in that mood, aggravatingly
indirect. He joked and teased and carried on like a small boy; and insisted on
ordering an elaborate dinner and a bottle of champagne, in the face of even
Johnny&#8217;s scandalized expostulations. When Johnny protested against
expenditure, it was time to look out!</p>

<p>&#8220;This is on me! This is my party! Dry up, Johnny!&#8221; cried Talbot.
&#8220;Fill your glasses. Drink to the new enterprise; the Undertakers&#8217;
Mining Company, Unlimited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undertakers?&#8221; I echoed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;Well, you
all look it. Call it the Gophers, then. Capital stock just eight hundred and
eighty dollars, fully subscribed. I suppose it is fully subscribed,
gentlemen?&#8221; He scrutinized us closely. &#8220;Ah, Frank! I see we&#8217;ll
have to take your promissory note. But the artistic certificates are not yet
home from the engravers. Take your time. Maybe a relative will die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talbot,&#8221; said I disgustedly, &#8220;if I hadn&#8217;t happened
to smell your breath before supper I&#8217;d think you drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> drunk, old deacon,&#8221; rejoined Talbot, &#8220;but with
the Wine of Enchantment&#8211;do you know your Persian? No? Well, then,
this:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Drink to me only with thine eyes,<br /> And I&#8217;ll not ask for
wine!&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>&#8220;A woman!&#8221; grumbled the literal Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;The best, the most capricious, the most beautiful woman in the
world,&#8221; cried Talbot, &#8220;whose smile intoxicates, whose frown drives
to despair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What <i>are</i> you drivelling about?&#8221; I demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The goddess fortune&#8211;what else? But come,&#8221; and Talbot rose
with a sudden and startling transition to the calm and businesslike. &#8220;We
can smoke outside; and we must hear each other&#8217;s reports.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paid for the dinner, steadfastly refusing to let us bear our share. I
noticed that he had acquired one of the usual buckskin sacks, and shook the
yellow dust from the mouth of it to the pan of the gold scales with quite an
accustomed air.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>We lit our pipes
and sat down at one end of the veranda, where we would not be interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire ahead, Yank,&#8221; advised Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two ways of going to the mines,&#8221; said Yank:
&#8220;One is to go overland by horses to Sutter&#8217;s Fort or the new town of
Sacramento, and then up from there into the foothills of the big mountains way
yonder. The other is to take a boat and go up river to Sacramento and then pack
across with horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much is the river fare?&#8221; asked Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have to get a sailboat. It costs about forty dollars
apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long would it take?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four or five days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how long from here to Sutter&#8217;s Fort by horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depends then on whether horses are cheaper here or there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are cheaper there; or we can get our stuff freighted in by
Greasers and hoof it ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I should think we ought to have a boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got one,&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; cried Talbot. &#8220;You&#8217;re a man after my
own heart! Well, Johnny?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny told his tale, a little proudly and produced his required two hundred
and twenty dollars.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had luck,&#8221; said Talbot non-committally, &#8220;and you ran a
strong risk of coming back here without a cent, didn&#8217;t you? I want to ask
you one question, Johnny. If you had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_118'></a>118</span> lost, would you have been willing to have taken the
consequences?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Johnny blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have been willing to have dropped out of this
partnership?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Talbot kindly, &#8220;that you had no right to try
to get this money by merely a gambler&#8217;s chance unless you were willing to
accept the logical result if you failed. It isn&#8217;t fair to the rest of
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what you mean,&#8221; said Johnny slowly. &#8220;No; I
hadn&#8217;t thought of it that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I said, you had luck,&#8221; repeated Talbot cheerfully,
&#8220;so we needn&#8217;t think of it further.&#8221; It was characteristic
that Johnny took this veiled rebuke from Talbot Ward in a meek and chastened
spirit; from any one else his high temper could never stand even a breath of
criticism. &#8220;How about you, Frank?&#8221; Talbot asked me.</p>

<p>I detailed my experiences in a very few words and exhibited my gold slug.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the best I can do,&#8221; I ended, &#8220;and half of
that does not belong to me. I can, however, in a few days scrape up the full
amount; there is plenty to do here. And barring bull luck, like Johnny&#8217;s,
I don&#8217;t see much show of beating that, unless a man settled down to stay
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot stared at me, ruminatively, until I began to get restive. Then he
withdrew his eyes. He made no comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have your money,&#8221; suggested Yank to him, after a
pause.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_119'></a>119</span>&#8220;Oh&#8211;yes,&#8221; said Talbot as though
awaking from profound reverie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell us about it. How did you get it? How long did it take
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About half an hour. I figured that everybody in a place like this
would be wanting news. So I sorted out that bundle of old newspapers you fellows
were always laughing at, and I went out and sold them. Lucky I got busy with
them early; for I don&#8217;t doubt the arrival of the <i>Oregon</i> broke the
market.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much did you get for them?&#8221; asked Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dollar apiece for most, and fifty cents for the rest. I came out two
hundred and seventy dollars ahead all told. That, with Frank&#8217;s and my ten
dollars, gave me sixty dollars above the necessary amount.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny arose and kicked himself solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;For not guessing what newspapers were good for,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;Go on! What next? What did you do with the rest of the day?&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot leaned forward, and all the animation of the dinner table returned to
his manner and to his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; said he earnestly, &#8220;this is the most wonderful town
that has ever been! There has been nothing like it in the past; and there will
never be anything like it again. After I had sold out my papers I went wandering
across the Plaza with my hands in my pockets. Next the El Dorado there is a hole
in the ground. It isn&#8217;t much of a hole, and the edges are all caving in
because it is sandy. While I was looking at it two men came along. One was the
owner of the hole, and the other said he was a lawyer. The owner <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span> offered to rent the hole
to the lawyer for two hundred and fifty dollars a month; and the lawyer was
inclined to take him up. After they had gone on I paced off the hole, just for
fun. It was twelve feet square by about six feet deep! Then I walked on down
toward the water front, and talked with all the storekeepers. They do a queer
business. All these goods we see around came out here on consignment. The local
storekeepers have a greater or lesser share and sell mainly on commission. Since
they haven&#8217;t any adequate storehouses, and can&#8217;t get any put up
again, they sell the stuff mainly at auction and get rid of it as quickly as
possible. That&#8217;s why some things are so cheap they can make pavements of
them when a ship happens to come in loaded with one article. I talked with some
of them and told them they ought to warehouse a lot of this stuff so as to keep
it over until the market steadied. They agreed with that; but pointed out that
they were putting up warehouses as fast as they could&#8211;which wasn&#8217;t
very fast&#8211;and in the meantime the rains and dust were destroying their
goods. It was cheaper to sell at auction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a heap more exciting,&#8221; put in Johnny. &#8220;I went to one
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wandered down to the shore, and looked out over the bay. It
was full of shipping, riding high at anchor. I had an idea. I hired a boat for
five dollars, and rowed out to some of the ships. Believe me or not, most of
them were empty; not even a watchman aboard! I found some of the captains,
however, and talked with each of them. They all told the same story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Crews skipped to the mines, I suppose?&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;Exactly.
And they <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> get any more. So I offered to hire a few of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The captains?&#8221; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>what?</i>&#8221; we yelled in chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the captains can&#8217;t get crews&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want to sail them,&#8221; went on Talbot
impatiently. &#8220;It was hard work getting them to agree; they all cherished
notions they could get crews and go sailing some more&#8211;good old salts! But
I hired four, at last. Had to take them for only a month, however; and had to
pay them in advance five hundred apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon,&#8221; said Johnny softly, &#8220;for interrupting your
pleasing tale; but the last item interested me. I do not know whether I quite
heard it right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up, Johnny,&#8221; said Yank; &#8220;let the man tell his
story. Of course he didn&#8217;t have the money in his pocket. How did you get
it, Tal?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ward shot him a grateful glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told them I&#8217;d pay them at four o&#8217;clock which gave me
plenty of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two thousand dollars&#8211;oh, of course!&#8221; murmured Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;So then,&#8221; continued Talbot, &#8220;I hustled ashore; and went to
see some of my merchant friends. In two hours I had contracts with twelve of
them that totalled six thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t some of them go out and hire ships on their own
account?&#8221; asked Yank shrewdly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>&#8220;Because I
didn&#8217;t mention the word &#8216;ship&#8217; until I had their business,&#8221;
said Talbot. &#8220;I just guaranteed them storage, waterproof, practically
fireproof, dustproof, and within twenty-four hours. I guess most of them thought
I was crazy. But as it didn&#8217;t cost them anything, they were willing to
take a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t raise your ten thousand dollars from them in
advance payments!&#8221; I marvelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. That would have scared off the whole lot of them. But I
got their agreements; I told you it took me two hours. Then I walked up the
street figuring where I&#8217;d get the money. Of course I saw I&#8217;d have to
divide the profits. I didn&#8217;t know anybody; but after a while I decided
that the best chance was to get some advice from honest and disinterested man.
So I asked the first man I met who ran the biggest gambling place in town. He
told me Jim Recket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim Recket?&#8221; I echoed. &#8220;He&#8217;s the man I was to leave
change for my gold slug with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Recket keeps the El Dorado, next door in the tent. He impressed me as
a very quiet, direct, square sort of a fellow. The best type of professional
gambler, in matters of this sort, generally is.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am looking for a man,&#8217; said I, &#8216;who has a little idle money,
some time, no gold-mining fever, plenty of nerve, and a broad mind. Can you tell
me who he is?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He thought a minute and then answered direct, as I knew he would.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sam Brannan,&#8217; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tell me about him.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>&#8220;&#8216;To take
up your points,&#8217; said Recket, checking off his fingers, &#8216;he came out with
a shipload of Mormons as their head, and he collected tithes from them for over
a year; that&#8217;s your idle money. He has all the time the Lord stuck into
one day at a clip; that&#8217;s your &#8220;some time.&#8221; He has been here
in the city since &#8217;48 which would seem to show he doesn&#8217;t care much for
mining. He collected the tithes from those Mormons, and sent word to Brigham
Young that if he wanted the money to come and get it. That&#8217;s for your
nerve. As for being broad minded&#8211;well, when a delegation of the Mormons,
all ready for a scrap, came to him solemnly to say that they were going to
refuse to pay him the tithes any more, even if he was the California head of the
church, he laughed them off the place for having been so green as to pay them as
long as they had.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found Sam Brannan, finally, at the bar in Dennison&#8217;s
Exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was he like?&#8221; asked Johnny eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet I
heard his name fifty times to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a thickset, jolly looking, curly headed fellow, with a thick
neck, a bulldog jaw, and a big voice,&#8221; replied Talbot. &#8220;Of course he
tried to bully me, but when that didn&#8217;t work, he came down to business. We
entered into an agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brannan was to furnish the money, and take half the profits, provided
he liked the idea. When we had settled it all, I told him my scheme. He thought
it over a while and came in. Then we rowed off and paid the captains of the
ships. It was necessary now to get them warped in <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span> at high tide, of course, but Sam
Brannan said he&#8217;d see to that&#8211;he has some sort of a pull with the
natives, enough to get a day&#8217;s labour, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Warp them in?&#8221; I echoed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. You couldn&#8217;t expect the merchants to lighter their
stuff off in boats always. We&#8217;ll beach these ships at high tide, and then
run some sort of light causeway out to them. There&#8217;s no surf, and the
bottom is soft. It&#8217;ll cost us something, of course; but Sam and I figure
we ought to divide three thousand clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask a question or so,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;What&#8217;s to prevent the merchants doing this same hiring of ships for
themselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Talbot, &#8220;after the first month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what prevented Brannan, after he had heard your scheme, from going
out on his own hook, and pocketing <i>all</i> the proceeds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, Frank,&#8221; said Talbot impatiently.
&#8220;Men of our stamp don&#8217;t do those things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;made it about two o&#8217;clock, as I
figure your story. Did you then take a needed rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quarter of two,&#8221; corrected Talbot, &#8220;I was going back to
the hotel, when I passed that brick building&#8211;you know, on Montgomery
Street. I remembered then that lawyer and his two hundred and fifty dollars for
a hole in the ground. It seemed to me there was a terrible waste somewhere. Here
was a big brick building filled up with nothing but goods. It might much better
be filled with people. There is plenty of room for goods in those ships; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span> but you can&#8217;t very
well put people on the ships. So I just dropped in to see them about it. I
offered to hire the entire upper part of the building; and pointed out that the
lower part was all they could possibly use as a store. They said they needed the
upper part as storehouse. I offered to store the goods in an accessible safe
place. Of course they wanted to see the place; but I wouldn&#8217;t let on,
naturally, but left it subject to their approval after the lease was signed. The
joke of it is they were way overstocked anyway. Finally I made my grand
offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look here,&#8217; said I, &#8216;you rent me that upper story for a decent
length of time&#8211;say a year&#8211;and I&#8217;ll buy out the surplus stock
you&#8217;ve got up there at a decent valuation.&#8217; They jumped at that; of
course they pretended not to, but just the same they jumped. I&#8217;ll either
sell the stuff by auction, even if at a slight loss, or else I&#8217;ll stick it
aboard a ship. Depends a good deal on what is there, of course. It&#8217;s
mostly bale and box goods of some sort or another. I&#8217;ve got an inventory
in my pocket. Haven&#8217;t looked at it yet. Then I&#8217;ll partition off that
wareroom and rent it out for offices and so forth. There are a lot of lawyers
and things in this town just honing for something dignified and stable. I only
pay three thousand a month for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny groaned deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; persisted Talbot, &#8220;I figure on getting at least
eight thousand a month out of it. That&#8217;ll take care of a little loss on
the goods, if necessary. I&#8217;m not sure a loss is necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>&#8220;And how
much, about, are the goods?&#8221; I inquired softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Somewhere between ten and twenty thousand, I
suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paid for how, and when?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One third cash, and the rest in notes. The interest out here is rather
high,&#8221; said Talbot regretfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you expect to get the money?&#8221; I insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, money! money!&#8221; cried Talbot, throwing out his arms with a
gesture of impatience. &#8220;The place is full of money. It&#8217;s pouring in
from the mines, from the world outside. Money&#8217;s no trouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>He fell into an intent reverie, biting at his short moustache. I arose softly
to my feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Johnny,&#8221; said I, in a strangled little voice, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to give back McGlynn&#8217;s change. Want to go with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>We tiptoed around the corner of the building, and fell into each
other&#8217;s arms with shrieks of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Johnny at last, wiping the tears from his eyes.
&#8220;Money&#8217;s no trouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>After we had to some extent relieved our feelings we changed my gold slug
into dust&#8211;I purchased a buckskin bag&#8211;and went to find McGlynn. Our
way to his quarters led past the post-office, where a long queue of men still
waited patiently and quietly in line. We stood for a few moments watching the
demeanour of those who had received their mail, or who had been told there was
nothing for them. Some of the latter were pathetic, and looked fairly dazed with
grief and disappointment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>The letters were
passed through a small window let in the adobe of the wall; and the men filed on
to the veranda at one end and off it at the other. The man distributing mail was
a small, pompous, fat Englishman. I recognized McGlynn coming slowly down with
the line, and paid him half the dust in my bag.</p>

<p>As McGlynn reached the window, the glass in it slammed shut, and the clerk
thrust a card against it.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mails close at 9 P.M.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>McGlynn tapped at the glass, received no attention, and commenced to beat a
tattoo. The window was snatched open, and the fat clerk, very red, thrust his
face in the opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he demanded truculently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any letters for John A. McGlynn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This office opens at 8:30 A.M.&#8221; said the clerk, slamming shut
the window.</p>

<p>Without an instant&#8217;s hesitation, and before the man had a chance to
retire, McGlynn&#8217;s huge fist crashed through the glass and into his
face.</p>

<p>The crowd had waited patiently; but now, with a brutal snarl, it surged
forward. McGlynn, a pleasant smile on his face, swung slowly about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your line, boys! Keep your line!&#8221; he boomed.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no trouble! It&#8217;s only a little Englishman who
don&#8217;t know our ways yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inside the building the postal force, white and scared yet over the menacing
growl of the beast they had so nearly roused, hastened to resume their tasks. I
heard later that the last man in line reached the window only at three <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span> o&#8217;clock in the
morning. Also that next day McGlynn was summoned by Geary, then postmaster, to
account for his share in the row; and that in the end Geary apologized and was
graciously forgiven by McGlynn! I can well believe it.</p>

<p>We found Yank and Talbot still at the edge of the hotel veranda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Tal!&#8221; said Johnny at once. &#8220;How are you going
to finish all this business you&#8217;ve scared up, and get off to the mines
within a reasonable time? We ought to start pretty soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mines?&#8221; echoed Talbot, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to the mines!
I wouldn&#8217;t leave all this for a million mines. No: Yank and I have been
talking it over. You boys will have to attend to the mining end of this
business. I&#8217;ll pay Frank&#8217;s share and take a quarter of the profits,
and Frank can pay me in addition half his profits. In return for the work I
don&#8217;t do, I&#8217;ll put aside two hundred and twenty dollars and use it
in my business here, and all of us will share in the profits I make from that
amount. How does that strike you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to lose you out of this,&#8221; said Johnny
disappointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I hate to lose the adventure, boys,&#8221; agreed Talbot
earnestly. &#8220;But, honestly, I can&#8217;t leave this place now even if I
want to; and I certainly don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned in that night with the feeling that I had passed a very interesting
day.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>UP-RIVER</span></h2>

<p>Two days later Yank, Johnny, and I embarked aboard a small bluff-bowed
sailboat, waved our farewells to Talbot standing on the shore, and laid our
course to cross the blue bay behind an island called Alcatraz. Our boatman was a
short, swarthy man, with curly hair and gold rings in his ears. He handled his
boat well, but spoke not at all. After a dozen attempts to get something more
than monosyllables out of him, we gave it up, and settled ourselves to the solid
enjoyment of a new adventure.</p>

<p>The breeze was strong, and drove even our rather clumsy craft at considerable
speed. The blue waters of the bay flashed in the sun and riffled under the
squalls. Spray dashed away from our bows. A chill raced in from the open
Pacific, diluting the sunlight.</p>

<p>We stared ahead of us, all eyes. The bay was a veritable inland sea; and the
shores ahead of us lay flat and wide, with blue hazy hills in the distance, and
a great mountain hovering in midair to our right. Black cormorants going upwind
flapped heavily by us just above the water, their necks stretched out. Gulls
wheeled and screamed above us, or floated high and light like corks over the
racing waves. Rafts of ducks lay bobbing, their necks furled, their head close
to their bodies. A salt <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_130'></a>130</span> tang stirred our blood; and on the great mountain
just north of the harbour entrance the shadows of cañons were beginning most
beautifully to define themselves.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a pleasant sail. We perched to windward, and smoked our
pipes, and worked ourselves to a high pitch of enthusiasm over what we were
going to see and do. The sailor too smoked his pipe, leaning against the long,
heavy tiller.</p>

<p>The distant flat shores drew nearer. We turned a corner and could make out
the mouth of a river, and across it a white line that, as we came up on it,
proved to be the current breaking against the wind over a very solid bar. For
the first time our sailor gave signs of life. He stood on his feet, squinted
ahead, ordered us amidships, dropped the peak of the mainsail, took the sheet in
his hand. We flew down against the breakers. In a moment we were in them. Two
sickening bumps shook our very vertebræ. The mast swayed drunkenly from side to
side as the boat rolled on her keel, the sail flopped, a following wave slopped
heavily over the stern, and the water swashed forward across our feet. Then we
recovered a trifle, staggered forward, bumped twice more, and slid into the
smoother deep water. The sailor grunted, and passed us a dipper. We bailed her
out while he raised again the peak of his sail.</p>

<p>Shortly after this experience we glided up the reaches of a wide beautiful
river. It had no banks, but was bordered by the tall reeds called tules. As far
as the eye could reach, and that was very far when we climbed part way up the
mast to look, these tules extended. League after <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span> league they ran away like illimitable
plains, green and brown and beautiful, until somewhere over the curve of the
earth straight ahead they must have met distant blue hills. To the southeast
there seemed no end but the sky.</p>

<p>From the level of the boat, however, we saw only a little way into the outer
fringe. The water lay among the stalks, and mud hens with white bills pushed
their way busily into intricate narrow unguessed waterways. Occasionally the
hedge of the tules broke to a greater or lesser opening into a lagoon. These
were like shallow lakes, in which sometimes grew clumps of grasses. They were
covered with waterfowl. Never have I seen so many ducks and geese of all kinds.
They literally covered the surface of the water, and fairly seemed to jostle
each other as they swam busily to and fro, intent on some business of their own.
Their comfortable, low conversational clucking and quacking was a pleasure to
hear. When, out of curiosity, we fired a revolver shot, they rose in the air
with a roar like that of a great waterfall, and their crossing lines of flight
in the sky was like the multitude of midges in the sun. I remember one flock of
snow-white geese that turned and wheeled, alternately throwing their bodies in
shadow or in the sunlight, so that they flashed brilliantly.</p>

<p>As the sun declined, the wind fell. Fortunately the current in the river was
hardly perceptible. We slipped along on glassy waters. Thousands upon thousands
of blackbirds dipped across us uttering their calls. Against a saffron sky were
long lines of waterfowl, their necks outstretched. A busy multitudinous noise of
marsh birds <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span> rose
and fell all about us. The sun was a huge red ball touching the distant
hills.</p>

<p>At last the wind failed us entirely, but the sailor got out a pair of sweeps,
and we took turns rowing. Within a half hour we caught the silhouette of three
trees against the sky, and shortly landed on a little island of solid ground.
Here we made camp for the night.</p>

<p>All next day, and the days after, being luckily favoured by steady fair
winds, we glided up the river. I could not but wonder at the certainty with
which our sailor picked the right passage from the numerous false channels that
offered themselves. The water was beautifully clear and sweet; quite different
from the muddy currents of to-day. Shortly the solid ground had drawn nearer; so
that often we passed long stretches of earth standing above the tule-grown
water. Along these strips grew sycamore and cottonwood trees of great size, and
hanging vines of the wild grape. The trees were as yet bare of leaves, but
everything else was green and beautiful. We could see the tracks of many deer
along the flats, but caught no sight of the animals themselves. At one place,
however, we did frighten a small band of half a dozen elk. They crashed away
recklessly through the brush, making noise and splashing enough for a hundred.
Yank threw one of his little pea bullets after them; and certainly hit, for we
found drops of blood. The sailor shook his head disparagingly over the size of
the rifle balls, to Yank&#8217;s vast disgust. I never saw him come nearer to
losing his temper. As a matter of fact I think the sailor&#8217;s contention had
something in it; the long accurate weapon with its tiny missile <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span> was probably all right
when its user had a chance to plant the bullet exactly in a fatal spot, but not
for such quick snap shooting as this. At any rate our visions of cheap fresh
meat vanished on the hoof.</p>

<p>The last day out we came into a wide bottomland country with oaks. The
distant blue hills had grown, and had become slate-gray. At noon we discerned
ahead of us a low bluff, and a fork in the river; and among the oak trees the
gleam of tents, and before them a tracery of masts where the boats and small
ships lay moored to the trees. This was the <i>embarcadero</i> of Sutter&#8217;s
Fort beyond; or the new city of Sacramento, whichever you pleased. Here our boat
journey ended.</p>

<p>We disembarked into a welter of confusion. Dust, men, mules, oxen, bales,
boxes, barrels, and more dust. Everything was in the open air. Tents were
pitched in the open, under the great oaks, anywhere and everywhere. Next, the
river, and for perhaps a hundred yards from the banks, the canvas structures
were arranged in rows along what were evidently intended to be streets; but
beyond that every one simply &#8220;squatted&#8221; where he pleased. We tramped
about until we found a clear space, and there dumped down our effects. They were
simple enough; and our housekeeping consisted in spreading our blankets and
canvas, and unpacking our frying pan and pots. The entire list of our provisions
consisted of pork, flour, salt, tea, coffee, sugar, tobacco, and some
spirits.</p>

<p>After supper we went out in a body to see what we could find out concerning
our way to the mines. We did not even possess a definite idea as to where we
wanted to go!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>In this quest we
ran across our first definite discouragement. The place was full of men and they
were all willing to talk. Fully three quarters were, like ourselves, headed
toward the mines; and were consequently full of theoretical advice. The less
they actually knew the more insistent they were that theirs was the only one
sure route or locality or method. Of the remainder probably half were the
permanent population of the place, and busily occupied in making what money they
could. They were storekeepers, gamblers, wagon owners, saloonkeepers,
transportation men. Of course we could quickly have had from most of these men
very definite and practical advice as to where to go and how to get there; but
the advice would most likely have been strongly tempered with self-interest. The
rest of those we encountered were on their way back from the mines. And from
them we got our first dash of cold water in the face.</p>

<p>According to them the whole gold-fable was vastly exaggerated. To be sure
there was gold, no one could deny that, but it occurred very rarely, and in
terrible places to get at. One had to put in ten dollars&#8217; worth of work,
to get out one dollars&#8217; worth of dust. And provisions were so high that
the cost of living ate up all the profits. Besides, we were much too late. All
the good claims had been taken up and worked out by the earliest comers. There
was much sickness in the mines, and men were dying like flies. A man was a fool
ever to leave home but a double-dyed fool not to return there as soon as
possible. Thus the army of the discouraged. There were so many of them, and they
talked so convincingly, that I, for one, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_135'></a>135</span> felt my golden dream dissipating; and a glance at
Johnny&#8217;s face showed that he was much in the same frame of mind. We were
very young; and we had so long been keyed up so high that a reaction was almost
inevitable. Yank showed no sign; but chewed his tobacco imperturbably.</p>

<p>We continued our inquiries, however, and had soon acquired a mass of varied
information. The nearest mines were about sixty miles away; we could get our
freight transported that far by the native Californian <i>cargadores</i> at
fifty dollars the hundredweight. Or we could walk and carry our own goods. Or we
might buy a horse or so to pack in our belongings. If we wanted to talk to the
<i>cargadores</i> we must visit their camp over toward the south; if we wanted
to buy horses we could do nothing better than to talk to McClellan, at
Sutter&#8217;s Fort. Fifty dollars a hundred seemed pretty steep for freighting;
we would not be able to carry all we owned on our backs; we decided to try to
buy the horses.</p>

<p>Accordingly next morning, after a delicious sleep under the open sky, we set
out to cover the three or four miles to Sutter&#8217;s Fort.</p>

<p>This was my first sight of the California country landscape, and I saw it at
the most beautiful time of year. The low-rolling hills were bright green,
against which blended the darker green of the parklike oaks. Over the slopes
were washes of colour where the wild flowers grew, like bright scarves laid out
in the sun. They were of deep orange, or an equally deep blue, or, perhaps, of
mingled white and purple. Each variety, and there were many of them, seemed to
grow by itself so that the colours were <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_136'></a>136</span> massed. Johnny muttered something about &#8220;the
trailing glory&#8211;banners of the hills&#8221;; but whether that was a
quotation or just Johnny I do not know.</p>

<p>The air was very warm and grateful, and the sky extraordinarily blue.
Broad-pinioned birds wheeled slowly, very high; and all about us, on the tips of
swaying bushes and in the tops of trees, thousands of golden larks were singing.
They were in appearance like our meadow-larks back east, but their note was
quite different; more joyous and lilting, but with the same liquid quality. We
flushed many sparrows of different sorts; and we saw the plumed quail, the
gallant, trim, little, well-groomed gentlemen, running rapidly ahead of us. And
over it all showered the clear warmth of the sun, like some subtle golden ether
that dissolved and disengaged from the sleeping hills multitudinous hummings of
insects, songs of birds, odours of earth, perfumes of flowers.</p>

<p>In spite of ourselves our spirits rose. We forgot our anxious figurings on
ways and means, our too concentrated hopes of success, our feverish, intent,
single-minded desire for gold. Three abreast we marched forward through the
waving, shimmering wild oats, humming once more the strains of the silly little
song to which the gold seekers had elected to stride:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;I soon shall be in mining camps,<br /> And then I&#8217;ll look
around,<br /> And when I see the gold-dust there,<br /> I&#8217;ll pick it
off the ground.<br /> &#160;<br /> &#8220;I&#8217;ll scrape the mountains
clean, old girl,<br /> I&#8217;ll drain the rivers dry;<br /> I&#8217;m off
for California.<br /> Susannah, don&#8217;t you cry!&#8221;</p> </div><!--
poetry -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>Even old Yank
joined in the chorus, and he had about as much voice as a rusty windmill, and
about the same idea of tune as a hog has of war.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Susannah! don&#8217;t you cry for me!<br /> I&#8217;m off to
California with my washbowl on my knee!&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>We topped a rise and advanced on Sutter&#8217;s Fort as though we intended by
force and arms to take that historic post.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>SUTTER&#8217;S FORT</span></h2>

<p>Sutter&#8217;s Fort was situated at the edge of the live-oak park. We found
it to resemble a real fort, with high walls, bastions, and a single gate at each
end through which one entered to a large enclosed square, perhaps a hundred and
fifty yards long by fifty wide. The walls were not pierced for guns; and the
defence seemed to depend entirely on the jutting bastions. The walls were
double, and about twenty-five feet apart. Thus by roofing over this space, and
dividing it with partitions, Sutter had made up his barracks, blacksmith shop,
bakery, and the like. Later in our investigations we even ran across a woollen
factory, a distillery, a billiard room, and a bowling alley! At the southern end
of this long space stood a two-story house. Directly opposite the two-story
house and at the other end of the enclosure was an adobe corral.</p>

<p>The place was crowded with people. A hundred or so miners rushed here and
there on apparently very important business, or loafed contentedly against the
posts or the sun-warmth of adobe walls. In this latter occupation they were
aided and abetted by a number of the native Californians. Perhaps a hundred
Indians were leading horses, carrying burdens or engaged in some other heavy
toil. They were the first we had seen, and we examined <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span> them with considerable curiosity. A
good many of them were nearly naked; but some had on portions of battered
civilized apparel. Very few could make up a full suit of clothes; but contented
themselves with either a coat, or a shirt, or a pair of pantaloons, or even with
only a hat, as the case might be. They were very swarthy, squat,
villainous-looking savages, with big heads, low foreheads, coarse hair, and
beady little eyes.</p>

<p>We stopped for some time near the sentry box at the entrance, accustoming
ourselves to the whirl and movement. Then we set out to find McClellan. He was
almost immediately pointed out to us, a short, square, businesslike man, with a
hard gray face, dealing competently with the pressure. A score of men surrounded
him, each eager for his attention. While we hovered, awaiting our chance, two
men walked in through the gate. They were accorded the compliment of almost a
complete silence on the part of those who caught sight of them.</p>

<p>The first was a Californian about thirty-five or forty years of age, a man of
a lofty, stern bearing, swarthy skin, glossy side whiskers, and bright
supercilious eyes. He wore a light blue short jacket trimmed with scarlet and
with silver buttons, a striped silk sash, breeches of crimson velvet met below
by long embroidered deerskin boots. A black kerchief was bound crosswise on his
head entirely concealing the hair; and a flat-crowned, wide, gray hat heavily
ornamented with silver completed this gorgeous costume. He moved with the
assured air of the aristocrat. The splendour of his apparel, the beauty of his
face and figure, and the grace of his movements attracted the first <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span> glance from all eyes.
Then immediately he was passed over in favour of his companion.</p>

<p>The latter was a shorter, heavier man, of more mature years. In fact his side
whiskers were beginning to turn gray. His costume was plain, but exquisitely
neat, and a strange blend of the civil and the military. The jacket for example,
had been cut in the trim military fashion, but was worn open to exhibit the
snowy cascade of the linen beneath. But nobody paid much attention to the
man&#8217;s dress. The dignity and assured calm of his face and eye at once
impressed one with conviction of unusual quality.</p>

<p>Johnny stared for a moment, his brows knit. Then with an exclamation, he
sprang forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Sutter!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Sutter turned slowly, to look Johnny squarely in the face, his attitude one
of cold but courteous inquiry. Johnny was approaching, hat in hand. I confess he
astonished me. We had known him intimately for some months, and always as the
harum-scarum, impulsive, hail fellow, bubbling, irresponsible. Now a new Johnny
stepped forward, quiet, high-bred, courteous, self-contained. Before he had
spoken a word, Captain Sutter&#8217;s aloof expression had relaxed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon for addressing you so abruptly,&#8221; Johnny was
saying. &#8220;The surprise of the moment must excuse me. Ten years ago, sir, I
had the pleasure of meeting you at the time you visited my father in
Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy!&#8221; cried Sutter. &#8220;You are, of course the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span> son of Colonel Fairfax.
But ten years ago&#8211;you were a very young man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A small boy, rather,&#8221; laughed Johnny.</p>

<p>They chatted for a few moments, exchanging news, I suppose, though they had
drawn beyond our ear-shot. In a few moments we were summoned, and presented;
first to Captain Sutter, then to Don Gaspar Martinez. The latter talked English
well. Yank and I, both somewhat silent and embarrassed before all this splendour
of manner, trailed the triumphal progress like two small boys. We were glad to
trail, however. Captain Sutter took us about, showing us in turn all the many
industries of the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old peaceful life is gone,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The fort has
become a trading post for miners. It is difficult now to get labour for my
crops, and I have nearly abandoned cultivation. My Indians I have sent out to
mine for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He showed us a row of long troughs outside the walls to which his Indian
workmen had come twice a day for their rations of wheat porridge. &#8220;They
scooped it out with their hands,&#8221; he told us, &#8220;like animals.&#8221;
Also he pointed out the council circle beneath the trees where he used to meet
the Indians. He had great influence with the surrounding tribes; and had always
managed to live peacefully with them.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is passing,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The American miners, quite
naturally, treat them as men; and they are really children. It makes
misunderstanding, and bloodshed, and reprisals. The era of good feeling is about
over. They still trust me, however, and will work for me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>Don Gaspar here
excused himself on the ground of business, promising to rejoin us later.</p>

<p>&#8220;That trouble will come upon us next,&#8221; said Captain Sutter,
nodding after the Spaniard&#8217;s retreating form. &#8220;It is already
beginning. The Californians hold vast quantities of land with which they do
almost nothing. A numerous and energetic race is coming; and it will require
room. There is conflict there. And their titles are mixed; very mixed. It will
behoove a man to hold a very clear title when the time comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own titles are doubtless clear and strong,&#8221; suggested
Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;None better. My grant here came directly from the Mexican government
itself.&#8221; The Captain paused to chuckle, &#8220;I suspect that the reason
it was given me so freely was political&#8211;there existed at that time a
desire to break up the power of the Missions; and the establishment of rival
colonies on a large scale would help to do that. The government evidently
thought me competent to undertake the opening of this new country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your grant is a large one?&#8221; surmised Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty miles by about twelve,&#8221; said Captain Sutter.</p>

<p>We had by now finished our inspection, and stood by the southern gate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Captain Sutter, &#8220;that I am not in a
position to offer you hospitality. My own residence is at a farm on the Feather
River. This fort, as no doubt you are aware, I have sold to the traders. In the
changed conditions it is no longer necessary to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you not regret the changed conditions?&#8221; asked <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span> Johnny after a moment.
&#8220;I can imagine the interest in building a new community&#8211;all these
industries, the training of the Indians to work, the growing of crops, the
raising of cattle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One may regret changed conditions; but one cannot prevent their
changing,&#8221; said Captain Sutter in his even, placid manner. &#8220;The old
condition was a very pleasant dream; this is a reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked back through the enclosure. Our companion was greeted on all sides
with the greatest respect and affection. To all he responded with benign but
unapproachable dignity. From the vociferating group he called the trader,
McClellan, to whom he introduced us, all three, with urbane formality.</p>

<p>&#8220;These young men,&#8221; he told McClellan, who listened to him
intently, his brows knit, &#8220;are more than acquaintances, they are very
especial old friends of mine. I wish to bespeak your good offices for what they
may require. They are on their way to the mines. And now, gentlemen, I repeat, I
am delighted to have had this opportunity; I wish you the best of luck; and I
sincerely hope you may be able to visit me at Feather River, where you are
always sure of a hearty welcome. Treat them well, McClellan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Cap&#8217;n, friends of your&#8217;n are friends of mine,&#8221; said
McClellan briefly.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour we found ourselves in possession of two
pack-horses and saddles, and a load of provisions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out for hoss thieves,&#8221; advised McClellan. &#8220;These
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span> yere Greasers will
follow you for days waitin&#8217; for a chance to git your stock. Don&#8217;t
picket with rawhide rope or the coyotes are likely to knaw yore animiles loose.
Better buy a couple of ha&#8217;r ropes from the nearest Mex. Take care of yoreselves.
Good-bye.&#8221; He was immediately immersed in his flood of business.</p>

<p>We were in no hurry to return, so we put in an hour or so talking with the
idlers. From them we heard much praise for Sutter. He had sent out such and such
expeditions to rescue snow-bound immigrants in the mountains; he had received
hospitably the travel-worn transcontinentals; he had given freely to the
indigent; and so on without end. I am very glad that even at second hand I had
the chance to know this great-hearted old soldier of Charles X while in the
glory of his possessions and the esteem of men. Acre by acre his lands were
filched from him; and he died in Washington vainly petitioning Congress for
restitution.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GOLD TRAIL</span></h2>

<p>We loaded our pack-horses, and set off next morning early on the trail up the
American River. At last, it seemed to us, we were really under way; as though
our long journeyings and many experiences had been but a preparation for this
start. Our spirits were high, and we laughed and joked and sang extravagantly.
Even Yank woke up and acted like a frisky colt. Such early wayfarers as we met,
we hailed with shouts and chaffing; nor were we in the least abashed by an
occasional surly response, or the not infrequent attempts to discourage our
hopes. For when one man said there was no gold, another was as confident that
the diggings were not even scratched.</p>

<p>The morning was a very fine one; a little chilly, with a thin white mist
hanging low along the ground. This the sun soon dissipated. The birds sang
everywhere. We trudged along the dusty road merrily.</p>

<p>Every little while we stopped to readjust the burdens to our animals. A
mountaineer had showed us how to lash them on, but our skill at that sort of
thing was <i>miner&#8217;s</i>, and the packs would not hold. We had to do them
one at a time, using the packed animal as a pattern from which to copy the
hitch on the other. In this painful manner <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_149'></a>149</span> we learned the Squaw Hitch, which, for a long time,
was to be the extent of our knowledge. However, we got on well enough, and
mounted steadily by the turns and twists of an awful road, following the general
course of the river below us.</p>

<p>On the hills grew high brush, some of it very beautiful. The buckthorn, for
example, was just coming out; and the dogwood, and the mountain laurel. At first
these clumps of bush were few and scattered; and the surface of the hills,
carpeted with short grass, rolled gently away, or broke in stone dikes and
outcrops. Then later, as we mounted, they drew together until they covered the
mountainsides completely, save where oaks and madrone kept clear some space for
themselves. After a time we began to see a scrubby long-needled pine thrusting
its head here and there above the undergrowth. That was as far as we got that
day. In the hollow of a ravine we found a tiny rill of water, and there we
camped. Johnny offered some slight objections at first. It was only two
o&#8217;clock of the afternoon, the trees were scrubby, the soil dusty, the
place generally uncomfortable. But Yank shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we knew how they played this game, it might be all right to go
ahead. But we don&#8217;t,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been noticing this
trail pretty close; and I ain&#8217;t seen much water except in the river; and
that&#8217;s an awful ways down. Maybe we&#8217;ll find some water over the next
hill, and maybe we won&#8217;t. But we <i>know</i> there&#8217;s water here. Then
there&#8217;s the question of hoss thieves. McClellan strikes me as a man to be
believed. I don&#8217;t know how they act; but you bet no hoss thief gets off
with my hoss and me watchin&#8217;. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_150'></a>150</span> But at night it&#8217;s different, I don&#8217;t
know how they do things. But I <i>do</i> know that if we tie our hosses next us,
they won&#8217;t be stolen. And that&#8217;s what I aim to do. But if we do
that, we got to give them a chance to eat, hain&#8217;t we? So we&#8217;ll let
them feed the rest of the afternoon, and we&#8217;ll tie em up
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was much talk for Yank. In fact, the only time that taciturn individual
ever would open up was in explanation of or argument about some expedient of
wilderness life or travel. It sounded entirely logical. So we made camp.</p>

<p>Yank turned the two horses out into a grass meadow, and sat, his back against
an oak tree, smoking his pipe and watching them. Johnny and I unrolled the beds,
sorted out the simple cooking utensils, and started to cook. Occasional
travellers on the road just above us shouted out friendly greetings. They were a
miscellaneous lot. Most were headed toward the mountains. These journeyed in
various ways. Some walked afoot and unencumbered, some carried apparently all
their belongings on their backs, one outfit comprising three men had three
saddle horses and four packs&#8211;a princely caravan. One of the
<i>cargadores&#8217;</i> pack-trains went up the road enveloped in a thick cloud
of dust&#8211;twenty or thirty pack-mules and four men on horseback herding them
forward. A white mare, unharnessed save for a clanging bell, led the way; and
all the mules followed her slavishly, the nose of one touching the tail of the
other, as is the mule&#8217;s besotted fashion. They were gay little animals,
with silver buttons on their harness, and yellow <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span> sheepskin linings to their saddles.
They carried a great variety of all sorts of things; and at the freighting rates
quoted to us must have made money for their owners. Their drivers were a
picturesque quartette in sombreros, wide sashes, and flowing garments. They sat
their animals with a graceful careless ease beautiful to behold.</p>

<p>Near sundown two horsemen turned off the trail and rode down to our little
trickle of water. When they drew near we recognized in one of them Don Gaspar
Martinez. He wore still his gorgeous apparel of the day before, with only the
addition of a pair of heavy silver ornamented spurs on his heels, and a brace of
pistols in his sash. His horse, a magnificent chestnut, was harnessed in equal
gorgeousness, with silvered broad bit, silver chains jangling therefrom, a
plaited rawhide bridle and reins, a carved leather, high-pommelled saddle, also
silver ornamented, and a bright coloured, woven saddle blanket beneath. The
animal stepped daintily and proudly, lifting his little feet and planting them
among the stones as though fastidiously. The man who rode with Don Gaspar was
evidently of a lower class. He was, however, a straight handsome young fellow
enough, with a dark clear complexion, a small moustache, and a pleasant smile.
His dress and accoutrements were on the same general order as those of Don
Gaspar, but of quieter colour and more serviceable material. His horse, however,
was of the same high-bred type. A third animal followed, unled, packed with two
cowhide boxes.</p>

<p>The Spaniard rode up to us and saluted courteously; then his eye lit with
recognition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_152'></a>152</span>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the good friends
of our Capitan Sutter! This is to be well met. If it is not too much I would beg
the favour of to camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means, Don Gaspar,&#8221; said Johnny rising. &#8220;The
pleasure is of course our own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again saluting us, Don Gaspar and his companion withdrew a short distance up
the little meadow. There the Spaniard sat down beneath a bush and proceeded to
smoke a cigaretto, while his companion unsaddled the horses, turned them loose
to graze, stacked up their saddles, and made simple camping arrangements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Plush Pants doesn&#8217;t intend to do any work if he catches
sight of it first,&#8221; observed Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably the other man is a servant?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;More likely a sort of dependent,&#8221; amended Johnny. &#8220;They
run a kind of patriarchal establishment, I&#8217;ve been told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t use them big words, Johnny,&#8221; complained Yank, coming
up with the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant they make the poor relations and kid brothers do the
hustling,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I understand you,&#8221; said Yank. &#8220;I wish I could see what
<i>they</i> do with their hosses nights. I bet they know how. And if I was a
hoss thief, I&#8217;d surely take a long chance for that chestnut
gelding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might wander over later and find out,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;And get my system full of lead&#8211;sure,&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p>The two camps did not exchange visits. We caught the flicker of their little
fire; but we were really too tired <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_153'></a>153</span> to be curious, and we turned in early, our two
animals tied fast to small trees at our feet.</p>

<p>The next day lifted us into the mountains. Big green peaks across which hung
a bluish haze showed themselves between the hills. The latter were more
precipitous; and the brush had now given way to pines of better size and quality
than those seen lower down. The river foamed over rapids or ran darkling in
pools and stretches. Along the roadside, rarely, we came upon rough-looking log
cabins, or shacks of canvas, or tents. The owners were not at home. We thought
them miners; but in the light of subsequent knowledge I believe that
unlikely&#8211;the diggings were farther in.</p>

<p>We came upon the diggings quite suddenly. The trail ran around the corner of
a hill; and there they were below us! In the wide, dry stream bottom perhaps
fifty men were working busily, like a lot of ants. Some were picking away at the
surface of the ground, others had dug themselves down waist deep, and stooped
and rose like legless bodies. Others had disappeared below ground, and showed
occasionally only as shovel blades. From so far above the scene was very lively
and animated, for each was working like a beaver, and the red shirts made gay
little spots of colour. On the hillside clung a few white tents and log cabins;
but the main town itself, we later discovered, as well as the larger diggings,
lay around the bend and upstream.</p>

<p>We looked all about us for some path leading down to the river, but could
find none; so perforce we had to continue on along the trail. Thus we entered
the camp <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span> of
Hangman&#8217;s Gulch; for if it had been otherwise I am sure we would have
located promptly where we had seen those red-shirted men.</p>

<p>The camp consisted merely of a closer-knit group of tents, log shacks, and a
few larger buildings constructed of a queer combination of heavy hewn timbers
and canvas. We saw nobody at all, though in some of the larger buildings we
heard signs of life. However, we did not wait to investigate the wonders of
Hangman&#8217;s Gulch, but drove our animals along the one street, looking for
the trail that should lead us back to the diggings. We missed it, somehow, but
struck into a beaten path that took us upstream. This we followed a few hundred
yards. It proceeded along a rough, boulder-strewn river-bed, around a point of
rough, jagged rocks, and out to a very wide gravelly flat through which the
river had made itself a narrow channel. The flat swarmed with men, all of them
busy, and very silent.</p>

<p>Leading our pack-horses we approached the nearest pair of these men, and
stood watching them curiously. One held a coarse screen of willow which he shook
continuously above a common cooking-pot, while the other slowly shovelled earth
over this sieve. When the two pots, which with the shovel seemed to be all the
tools these men possessed, had been half filled thus with the fine earth, the
men carried them to the river. We followed. The miners carefully submerged the
pots, and commenced to stir their contents with their doubled fists. The light
earth muddied the water, floated upward, and then flowed slowly over the rim of
the pots and down the current. After a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_155'></a>155</span> few minutes of this, they lifted the pots
carefully, drained off the water, and started back.</p>

<p>&#8220;May we look?&#8221; ventured Johnny.</p>

<p>The taller man glanced at us, and our pack-horses, and nodded. This was the
first time he had troubled to take a good look at us. The bottom of the pot was
covered with fine black sand in which we caught the gleam and sparkle of
something yellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that gold?&#8221; I asked, awed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s gold,&#8221; the man repeated, his rather saturnine
features lighting up with a grin. Then seeing our interest, he unbent a trifle.
&#8220;We dry the sand, and then blow it away,&#8221; he explained; and strode
back to where his companion was impatiently waiting.</p>

<p>We stumbled on over the rocks and débris. There were probably something near
a hundred men at work in the gulch. We soon observed that the pot method was
considered a very crude and simple way of getting out the gold. Most of the men
carried iron pans full of the earth to the waterside, where, after submerging
until the lighter earth had floated off, they slopped the remainder over the
side with a peculiar twisting, whirling motion, leaving at last only the black
sand&#8211;and the gold! These pan miners were in the great majority. But one
group of four men was doing business on a larger scale. They had constructed
what looked like a very shallow baby-cradle on rockers into which they poured
their earth and water. By rocking the cradle violently but steadily, they
spilled the mud over the sides. Cleats had been nailed in the bottom to catch
the black sand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>We wandered
about here and there, looking with all our eyes. The miners were very busy and
silent, but quite friendly, and allowed us to examine as much as we pleased the
results of their operations. In the pots and cradles the yellow flake gold
glittered plainly, contrasting with the black sand. In the pans, however, the
residue spread out fan-shaped along the angle between the bottom and the side,
and at the apex the gold lay heavy and beautiful all by itself. The men were
generally bearded, tanned with working in this blinding sun, and plastered
liberally with the red earth. We saw some queer sights, however; as when we came
across a jolly pair dressed in what were the remains of ultra-fashionable
garments up to and including plug hats! At one side working some distance from
the stream were small groups of native Californians or Mexicans. They did not
trouble to carry the earth all the way to the river; but, after screening it
roughly, tossed it into the air above a canvas, thus winnowing out the heavier
pay dirt. I thought this must be very disagreeable.</p>

<p>As we wandered about here and there among all these men so busily engaged,
and with our own eyes saw pan after pan show gold, actual metallic guaranteed
gold, such as rings and watches and money are made of, a growing excitement
possessed us, the excitement of a small boy with a new and untried gun. We
wanted to get at it ourselves. Only we did not know how.</p>

<p>Finally Yank approached one of the busy miners.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stranger,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we&#8217;re new to this. Maybe you
can tell us where we can dig a little of this gold ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>The man
straightened his back, to exhibit a roving humorous blue eye, with which he
examined Yank from top to toe.</p>

<p>&#8220;If,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t for that eighteen-foot
cannon you carry over your left arm, and a cold gray pair of eyes you carry in
your head, I&#8217;d direct you up the sidehill yonder, and watch you sweat. As
it is, you can work anywhere anybody else isn&#8217;t working. Start
in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we dig right next to you, then?&#8221; asked Yank, nodding at an
unbroken piece of ground just upstream.</p>

<p>The miner clambered carefully out of his waist-deep trench, searched his
pockets, produced a pipe and tobacco. After lighting this he made Yank a low
bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the compliment; but I warn you, this claim of mine is not
very rich. I&#8217;m thinking of trying somewhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you get any gold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a few ounces a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That suits me for a beginning,&#8221; said Yank decidedly. &#8220;Come
on, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miner hopped back into his hole, only to stick his head out again for the
purpose of telling us:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you keep fifteen feet away!&#8221;</p>

<p>With eager hands we slipped a pick and shovels from beneath the pack ropes,
undid our iron bucket, and without further delay commenced feverishly to
dig.</p>

<p>Johnny held the pail, while Yank and I vied with each other in being the
first to get our shovelfuls into that receptacle. As a consequence we nearly
swamped the pail first off, and had to pour some of the earth out again. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span> Then we all three ran
down to the river and took turns stirring that mud pie beneath the gently
flowing waters in the manner of the &#8220;pot panners&#8221; we had first
watched. After a good deal of trouble we found ourselves possessed of a thick
layer of rocks and coarse pebbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;We forgot to screen it,&#8221; I pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t any screen,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s pick &#8217;em out by hand?&#8221; suggested Yank.</p>

<p>We did so. The process emptied the pail. Each of us insisted on examining
closely; but none of us succeeded in creating out of our desires any of that
alluring black sand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we can&#8217;t expect to get colour every time?&#8221;
observed Johnny disappointedly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>We tried her again: and yet again; and then some more; but always with the
same result. Our hands became puffed and wrinkled with constant immersion in the
water, and began to feel sore from the continual stirring of the rubble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something wrong,&#8221; grunted Johnny into the abysmal silence in
which we had been carrying on our work.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t expect it every time,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the others seem to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe we&#8217;ve struck a blank place; let&#8217;s try
somewhere else,&#8221; suggested Yank.</p>

<p>Johnny went over to speak to our neighbour, who was engaged in tossing out
shovelfuls of earth from an excavation into which he had nearly disappeared. At
Johnny&#8217;s hail, he straightened his back, so that his head bobbed out of
the hole like a prairie dog.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>&#8220;No, it
doesn&#8217;t matter where you dig,&#8221; he answered Johnny&#8217;s question.
&#8220;The pay dirt is everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>So we moved on a few hundred feet, picked another unoccupied patch, and
resumed our efforts. No greater success rewarded us here.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe maybe we ought to go deeper,&#8221; surmised Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of these fellows are taking their dirt right off top of the
ground,&#8221; objected Johnny.</p>

<p>However, we unlimbered the pickaxe and went deeper; to the extent of two feet
or more. It was good hard work, especially as we were all soft for it. The sun
poured down on our backs with burning intensity; our hands blistered; and the
round rocks and half-cemented rubble that made the bar were not the easiest
things in the world to remove. However, we kept at it. Yank and I, having in
times past been more or less accustomed to this sort of thing, got off much
easier than did poor Johnny. About two feet down we came to a mixed coarse sand
and stones, a little finer than the top dirt. This seemed to us promising, so we
resumed our washing operations. They bore the same results as had the first;
which was just the whole of nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to hit it somewhere,&#8221; said Johnny between his
teeth. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try another place.&#8221;</p>

<p>We scrambled rather wearily, but with a dogged determination, out of our
shallow hole. Our blue-eyed, long-bearded friend was sitting on a convenient
boulder near at hand, his pipe between his teeth, watching our operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got any tobacco, boys?&#8221; he inquired genially. &#8220;Smoked my
last until to-night, unless you&#8217;ll lend.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>Yank produced a
plug, from which the stranger shaved some parings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Struck the dirt?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;No, I see you
haven&#8217;t.&#8221; He stretched himself and arose. &#8220;You aren&#8217;t
washing this stuff!&#8221; he cried in amazement, as his eye took in fully what
we were about.</p>

<p>Then we learned what we might have known before&#8211;but how should
we?&#8211;that the gold was not to be found in any and every sort of loose earth
that might happen to be lying about, but only in either a sort of blue clay or a
pulverized granite. Sometimes this &#8220;pay dirt&#8221; would be found atop
the ground. Again, the miner had to dig for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the surface diggings are taken up,&#8221; our friend told us.
&#8220;So now you have to dig deep. It&#8217;s about four feet down where
I&#8217;m working. It&#8217;ll probably be deeper up here. You&#8217;d better
move back where you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yank, stretched himself upright.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said decidedly; &#8220;let&#8217;s get a little
sense into ourselves. Here&#8217;s our pore old hosses standing with their packs
on, and we no place to stay, and no dinner; and we&#8217;re scratchin&#8217;
away at this bar like a lot of fool hens. There&#8217;s other days
comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny and I agreed with the common sense of the thing, but reluctantly. Now
that we knew how, our enthusiasm surged up again. We wanted to get at it. The
stranger&#8217;s eyes twinkled sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, boys,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I know just how you feel. Come with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He snatched up our bucket and strode back to his <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span> own claim, where he filled the
receptacle with some of the earth he had thrown out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go pan that,&#8221; he advised us kindly.</p>

<p>We raced to the water, and once more stirred about the heavy contents of the
pail until they had floated off with the water. In the bottom lay a fine black
residue; and in that residue glittered the tiny yellow particles. We had
actually panned our first gold!</p>

<p>Our friend examined it critically.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about a twelve-cent pan,&#8221; he adjudged it.</p>

<p>Somehow, in a vague way, we had unreasonably expected millions at a twist of
the wrist; and the words, &#8220;twelve cents,&#8221; had a rankly penurious
sound to us. However, the miner patiently explained that a twelve-cent pan was a
very good one; and indubitably it was real gold.</p>

<p>Yank, being older and less excitable, had not accompanied us to the
waterside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;that twelve cents is highly
satisfactory, of course; but in the meantime we&#8217;ve lost about six hundred
dollars&#8217; worth of hoss and grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>Surely enough, our animals had tired of waiting for us, and had moved out
packs and all. We hastily shouldered our implements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to keep this claim next me?&#8221; inquired our
acquaintance.</p>

<p>We stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely!&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But how do we do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just leave your pick and shovel in the hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t some one steal them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_162'></a>162</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s to prevent?&#8221; I asked a
little skeptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miners&#8217; law,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>We almost immediately got trace of our strayed animals, as a number of men
had seen them going upstream. In fact we had no difficulty whatever in finding
them for they had simply followed up the rough stream-bed between the cañon
walls until it had opened up to a gentler slope and a hanging garden of grass
and flowers. Here they had turned aside and were feeding. We caught them, and
were just heading them back, when Yank stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with this here?&#8221; he inquired.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s feed, and water near, and it ain&#8217;t so very far back to
the diggings.&#8221;</p>

<p>We looked about us, for the first time with seeing eyes. The little
up-sloping meadow was blue and dull red with flowers; below us the stream
brawled foam flecked among black rocks; the high hills rose up to meet the sky,
and at our backs across the way the pines stood thick serried. Far up in the
blue heavens some birds were circling slowly. Somehow the leisurely swing of
these unhasting birds struck from us the feverish hurry that had lately filled
our souls. We drew deep breaths; and for the first time the great peace and
majesty of these California mountains cooled our spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a bully place, Yank,&#8221; said Johnny soberly,
&#8220;and that little bench up above us looks flat.&#8221;</p>

<p>We clambered across the slant of the flower-spangled meadow to the bench,
just within the fringe of the pines. It proved to be flat, and from the edge of
it down the hill seeped a little spring marked by the feathery bracken. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span> We entered a cool green
place, peopled with shadows and the rare, considered notes of soft-voiced birds.
Just over our threshold, as it were, was the sunlit, chirpy, buzzing,
bright-coloured, busy world. Overhead a wind of many voices hummed through the
pine tops. The golden sunlight flooded the mountains opposite, flashed from the
stream, lay languorous on the meadow. Long bars of it slanted through an
unguessed gap in the hills behind us to touch with magic the very tops of the
trees over our heads. The sheen of the precious metal was over the land.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FIRST GOLD</span></h2>

<p>We arose before daylight, picketed our horses, left our dishes unwashed, and
hurried down to the diggings just at sun-up carrying our gold pans or
&#8220;washbowls,&#8221; and our extra tools. The bar was as yet deserted. We
set to work with a will, taking turns with the pickaxe and the two shovels. I
must confess that our speed slowed down considerably after the first wild burst,
but we kept at it steadily. It was hard work, and there is no denying it, just
the sort of plain hard work the day labourer does when he digs sewer trenches in
the city streets. Only worse, perhaps, owing to the nature of the soil. It has
struck me since that those few years of hard labour in the diggings, from &#8217;49 to
&#8217;53 or &#8217;54, saw more actual manual toil accomplished than was ever before
performed in the same time by the same number of men. The discouragement of
those returning we now understood. They had expected to take the gold without
toil; and were dismayed at the labour it had required. At any rate, we thought
we were doing our share that morning, especially after the sun came up. We
wielded our implements manfully, piled our débris to one side, and gradually
achieved a sort of crumbling uncertain excavation reluctant to stay emptied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>About an hour
after our arrival the other miners began to appear, smoking their pipes. They
stretched themselves lazily, spat upon their hands, and set to. Our friend of
the day before nodded at us cheerfully, and hopped down into his hole.</p>

<p>We removed what seemed to us tons of rock. About noon, just as we were
thinking rather dispiritedly of knocking off work for a lunch&#8211;which in our
early morning eagerness we had forgotten to bring&#8211;Johnny turned up a
shovelful whose lower third consisted of the pulverized bluish clay. We promptly
forgot both lunch and our own weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey!&#8221; shouted our friend, scrambling from his own claim.
&#8220;Easy with the rocks! What are you conducting here? a volcano?&#8221; He
peered down at us. &#8220;Pay dirt, hey? Well, take it easy; it won&#8217;t run
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>Take it easy! As well ask us to quit entirely! We tore at the rubble, which
aggravatingly and obstinately cascaded down upon us from the sides; we scraped
eagerly for more of that blue clay; at last we had filled our three pans with a
rather mixed lot of the dirt, and raced to the river. Johnny fell over a boulder
and scattered his panful far and wide. His manner of scuttling back to the hole
after more reminded me irresistibly of the way a contestant in a candle race
hurries back to the starting point to get his candle relighted.</p>

<p>We panned that dirt clumsily and hastily enough; and undoubtedly lost much
valuable sand overside; but we ended each with a string of colour. We crowded
together comparing our &#8220;pans.&#8221; Then we went crazy. I suppose <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span> we had about a quarter
of a dollar&#8217;s worth of gold between us, but that was not the point. The
long journey with all its hardships and adventures, the toil, the uncertainty,
the hopes, the disappointments and reactions had at last their visible tangible
conclusion. The tiny flecks of gold were a symbol. We yapped aloud, we kicked up
our heels, we shook hands, we finally joined hands and danced around and
around.</p>

<p>From all sides the miners came running up, dropping their tools with a
clatter. We were assailed by a chorus of eager cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, boys?&#8221; &#8220;A strike?&#8221; &#8220;Whereabouts is
your claim?&#8221; &#8220;Is it &#8216;flour&#8217; or &#8216;flake&#8217;?&#8221;
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see!&#8221;</p>

<p>They crowded around in a dense mob, and those nearest jostled to get a
glimpse of our pans. Suddenly sobered by this interest in our doings, we would
have edged away could we have got hold of our implements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, I&#8217;ll be durned!&#8221; snorted a tall state of Maine man
in disgust. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t no strike! This is an insane
asylum.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news slowly penetrated the crowd. A roar of laughter went up. Most of the
men were hugely amused; but some few were so disgusted at having been fooled
that they were almost inclined to take it as a personal affront that we had not
made the expected &#8220;strike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think they was a bunch of confounded Keskydees,&#8221;
growled one of them.</p>

<p>The miners slowly dispersed, returning to their own diggings. Somewhat
red-faced, and very silent, we gathered up our pans and slunk back to the claim.
Our neighbour <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
stuck his head out of his hole. He alone had not joined the stampede in our
direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you like being popular heroes?&#8221; he grinned.</p>

<p>Johnny made as though to shy a rock at him, whereupon he ducked below
ground.</p>

<p>However, our spirits soon recovered. We dumped the black sand into a little
sack we had brought for the purpose. It made quite an appreciable bulge in that
sack. We did not stop to realize that most of the bulge was sack and sand, and
mighty little of it gold. It was something tangible and valuable; and we were
filled with a tremendous desire to add to its bulk.</p>

<p>We worked with entire absorption, quite oblivious to all that was going on
about us. It was only by accident that Yank looked up at last, so I do not know
how long Don Gaspar had been there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you look at that!&#8221; cried Yank.</p>

<p>Don Gaspar, still in his embroidered boots, his crimson velvet breeches, his
white linen, and his sombrero, but without the blue and silver jacket, was
busily wielding a pickaxe a hundred feet or so away. His companion, or servant,
was doing the heavier shovel work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, oh, why!&#8221; breathed Johnny at last, &#8220;do you suppose,
if he <i>must</i> mine, he doesn&#8217;t buy himself a suit of dungarees or a
flannel shirt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s the first hard work he ever did in his
life,&#8221; surmised Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll bet he won&#8217;t do that very long,&#8221; I
guessed.</p>

<p>But Don Gaspar seemed to have more sticking power than we gave him credit
for. We did not pay him much further <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_168'></a>168</span> attention, for we were busy with our own affairs;
but every time we glanced in his direction he appeared to be still at it. Our
sack of sand was growing heavier; as indeed were our limbs. As a matter of fact
we had been at harder work than any of us had been accustomed to, for very long
hours, beneath a scorching sun, without food, and under strong excitement. We
did not know when to quit; but the sun at last decided it for us by dipping
below the mountains to the west.</p>

<p>We left our picks and shovels in our pit; but carried back with us our pans,
for in them we wished to dry out our sand. The horses were still at their picket
ropes; and we noticed near the lower end of the meadow, but within the bushes,
three more animals moving slowly. A slim column of smoke ascended from beyond
the bushes. Evidently we had neighbours.</p>

<p>We were dog tired, and so far starved that we did not know we were hungry. My
eyes felt as though they must look like holes burned in a blanket. We lit a
fire, and near it placed our panful of sand. But we did not take time to cook
ourselves a decent meal; we were much too excited for that. A half-made pot of
coffee, some pork burned crisp, and some hard bread comprised our supper. Then
Yank and I took a handful of the dried sand in the other two pans, and commenced
cautiously to blow it away. Johnny hovered over us full of suggestions, and
premonitions of calamity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blow too, hard, fellows,&#8221; he besought us;
&#8220;you&#8217;ll blow away the gold! For heaven&#8217;s sake, go
easy!&#8221;</p>

<p>We growled at him, and blew. I confess that my heart went fast with great
anxiety, as though the stakes of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_169'></a>169</span> my correct blowing were millions. However, as we
later discovered, it is almost impossible to blow incorrectly.</p>

<p>There is something really a little awing about pure gold new-born from the
soil. Gold is such a stable article, so strictly guarded, so carefully checked
and counted, that the actual production of metal that has had no existence
savours almost of the alchemical. We had somewhat less than an ounce, to be
sure; but that amount in flake gold bulks considerably. We did not think of it
in terms of its worth in dollars; we looked on it only as the Gold, and we
stared at the substantial little heap of yellow particles with fascinated
awe.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DIGGINGS</span></h2>

<p>The following days were replicas of the first. We ate hurriedly at odd times;
we worked feverishly; we sank into our tumbled blankets at night too tired to
wiggle. But the buckskin sack of gold was swelling and rounding out most
satisfactorily. By the end of the week it contained over a pound!</p>

<p>But the long hours, the excitement, and the inadequate food told on our
nerves. We snapped at each other impatiently at times; and once or twice came
near to open quarrelling. Johnny and I were constantly pecking at each other
over the most trivial concerns.</p>

<p>One morning we were halfway to the bar when we remembered that we had
neglected to picket out the horses. It was necessary for one of us to go back,
and we were all reluctant to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be damned if I&#8217;m going to lug &#8217;way up that
hill,&#8221; I growled to myself. &#8220;I tied them up yesterday,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny caught this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it wasn&#8217;t your turn yesterday,&#8221; he pointed out,
&#8220;and it is to-day. I&#8217;ve got nothing to do with what you chose to do
yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or any other day,&#8221; I muttered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried Johnny
truculently. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t hear. Speak up!&#8221;</p>

<p>We were flushed, and eying each other malevolently.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do!&#8221; said Yank, with an unexpected tone of
authority. &#8220;Nobody will go back, and nobody will go ahead. We&#8217;ll
just sit down on this log, yere, while we smoke one pipe apiece. I&#8217;ve got
something to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny and I turned on him with a certain belligerency mingled with surprise.
Yank had so habitually acted the part of taciturnity that his decided air of
authority confused us. His slouch had straightened, his head was up, his mild
eye sparkled. Suddenly I felt like a bad small boy; and I believe Johnny was the
same. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation we sat down on the log.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Yank firmly, &#8220;it&#8217;s about time we took
stock. We been here now five days; we ain&#8217;t had a decent meal of vittles
in that time; we ain&#8217;t fixed up our camp a mite; we ain&#8217;t been to
town to see the sights; we don&#8217;t even know the looks of the man
that&#8217;s camped down below us. We&#8217;ve been too danged busy to be
decent. Now we&#8217;re goin&#8217; to call a halt. I should jedge we have a
pound of gold, or tharabouts. How much is that worth, Johnny? You can figger in
yore head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Along about two hundred and fifty dollars,&#8221; said Johnny after a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, keep on figgerin&#8217;. How much does that come to
apiece?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About eighty dollars, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And dividin&#8217; eighty by five?&#8221; persisted Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixteen.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_172'></a>172</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled Yank, his steely blue
eye softening to a twinkle, &#8220;sixteen dollars a day is fair wages, to be
sure; but nothin&#8217; to get wildly excited over.&#8221; He surveyed the two
of us with some humour. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t thought of it that way, had
you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Nuther had I until last night. I was so dog tired I
couldn&#8217;t sleep, and I got to figgerin&#8217; a little on my own
hook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I can do better than that in San Francisco&#8211;with half the
work!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe for a while,&#8221; said Yank, &#8220;but here we got a chance
to make a big strike most any time; and in the meantime to make good wages. But
we ain&#8217;t going to do it any quicker by killin&#8217; ourselves. Now to-day
is Sunday. I ain&#8217;t no religious man; but Sunday is a good day to quit. I
propose we go back to camp peaceable, make a decent place to stay, cook
ourselves up a squar&#8217; meal, wash out our clothes, visit the next camp,
take a look at town, and enjoy ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus vanished the first and most wonderful romance of the gold. Reduced to
wages it was somehow no longer so marvellous. The element of uncertainty was
always there, to be sure; and an inexplicable fascination; but no longer had we
any desire to dig up the whole place immediately. I suppose we moved nearly as
much earth, but the fibres of our minds were relaxed, and we did it more easily
and with less nervous wear and tear.</p>

<p>Also, as Yank suggested, we took pains to search out our fellow beings. The
camper below us proved to be Don Gaspar, velvet breeches and all. He received us
hospitably, and proffered perfumed cigarettos which we did not <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span> like, but which we
smoked out of politeness. Our common ground of meeting was at first the natural
one of the gold diggings. Don Gaspar and his man, whom he called Vasquez, had
produced somewhat less flake gold than ourselves, but exhibited a half-ounce
nugget and several smaller lumps. We could not make him out. Neither his
appearance nor his personal equipment suggested necessity; and yet he laboured
as hard as the rest of us. His gaudy costume was splashed and grimy with the red
mud, although evidently he had made some attempt to brush it. The linen was, of
course, hopeless. He showed us the blisters on his small aristocratic-looking
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the hard work&#8221; he stated simply, &#8220;but one gets the
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>From that subject we passed on to horses. He confessed that he was uneasy as
to the safety of his own magnificent animals; and succeeded in alarming us as to
our own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thos&#8217; Indian,&#8221; he told us, &#8220;are always out to
essteal; and the <i>paisanos</i>. It has been tole me that Andreas Amijo and his
robbers are near. Some day we loose our horse!&#8221;</p>

<p>Our anxiety at this time was given an edge by the fact that the horses,
having fed well, and becoming tired of the same place, were inclined to stray.
It was impossible to keep them always on picket lines&#8211;the nature of the
meadow would not permit it&#8211;and they soon learned to be very clever with
their hobbles. Several mornings we put in an hour or so hunting them up and
bringing them in before we could start work for the day. This wasted both time
and temper. The result was that we drifted <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_174'></a>174</span> into partnership with Don Gaspar and Vasquez. I do
not remember who proposed the arrangement; indeed, I am inclined to think it
just came about naturally from our many discussions on the subject. Under the
terms of it we appointed Vasquez to cook all the meals, take full care of the
horses, chop the wood, draw the water, and keep camp generally. The rest of us
worked in couples at the bar. We divided the gold into five equal parts.</p>

<p>Our production at this time ran from five to seven ounces a day, which was,
of course, good wages, but would not make our fortunes. We soon fell into a rut,
working cheerfully and interestedly, but without excitement. The nature of our
produce kept our attention. We should long since have wearied of any other job
requiring an equal amount of work, but there was a never-ending fascination in
blowing away the débris from the virgin gold. And one day, not far from us, two
Hollanders&#8211;&#8220;Dutch Charleys,&#8221; as the miners called that
nationality&#8211;scooped from a depression in the bedrock mixed coarse gold
thirty odd pounds in weight&#8211;over $5,000! That revived our interest, you
may be sure.</p>

<p>Most of the miners seemed content to stick to panning. Their argument was
that by this method they could accumulate a fair amount of dust, and ran just as
good chances of a &#8220;strike&#8221; as the next fellow. Furthermore, they had
no tools, no knowledge and no time to make cradles. Those implements had to be
very accurately constructed.</p>

<p>We discussed this matter almost every evening. Yank was a great believer in
improving the efficiency of our equipment.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_175'></a>175</span>&#8220;It&#8217;ll handle four or five times the
dirt,&#8221; said he &#8220;and that means four or five times the
dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no lumber to be had anywhere,&#8221; I objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where there&#8217;s three good stout boxes made of real lumber
that we can get for forty dollars,&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t cut that stuff up with an axe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John Semple has a saw, a plane, and a hammer; he&#8217;s a
carpenter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet he is!&#8221; agreed Johnny. &#8220;I was talking to him last
night. He won&#8217;t lend his tools; and he won&#8217;t hire them. He&#8217;ll
come with them for fifty dollars a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Yank, &#8220;let&#8217;s hire him. I&#8217;m
pretty handy, and I&#8217;ll stay right in camp and help him. Vasquez can go dig
instead of me. We can get &#8217;em cut out and fitted in two days, anyway.
We&#8217;ve got the money!&#8221;</p>

<p>I think none of us was very enthusiastic on this subject except Yank; but he
finally carried the day. Vasquez, somewhat to his chagrin, I thought, resumed
his shovel. Yank and John Semple tinkered away for the allotted two days, and
triumphantly produced two cradles at a cost of a round one hundred and fifty
dollars.</p>

<p>Although we had been somewhat doubtful as to the advisability of spending
this sum, I am bound to state that Yank&#8217;s insistence was justified. It
certainly made the work easier. We took turns shovelling the earth and pouring
in the water, and &#8220;rocking the baby.&#8221; Our production jumped two or
three ounces a day.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>BEGINNINGS OF GOVERNMENT</span></h2>

<p>Our visit to the town we postponed from day to day because we were either too
busy or too tired. We thought we could about figure out what that crude sort of
village would be like. Then on Saturday evening our neighbour with the twinkling
eye&#8211;whom we called McNally, without conviction, because he told us
to&#8211;informed us that there would be a miners&#8217; meeting next day, and
that we would be expected to attend.</p>

<p>Accordingly we visited the town. The street was full of men idling slowly to
and fro. All the larger structures were wide open, and from within could be
heard the sounds of hurdy-gurdies, loud laughter and noisy talk. At one end of
the street a group was organizing a horse race; and toward this Don Gaspar took
his immediate departure. A smaller group surrounded two wrestlers. At one side a
jumping match was going on.</p>

<p>Among the usual incongruities we saw some that amused us more than
ordinarily. The Indians, for example, were rather numerous, and remarkable. One
wore as his sole garment an old dress coat: another had tied a pair of trousers
around his waist; a third had piled a half dozen hats atop, one over the other;
and many had on two or more coats. They were, to a man, well drunken. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span> Their squaws, fat and
unattractive, squatted outside the single store of the place. We saw also a
dozen or so white men dressed very plainly and shabbily, tall, lank, and
spindly, rather weakly in general appearance, their faces sallow, their eyes
rather childish but crafty and treacherous, their hair thin and straight. The
points in common were pointed, nearly brimless hats, like small extinguishers,
and that they were the only men to use suspenders. They were from Pike County in
Missouri; and in our experience with them we found their appearance a close
indication of their character. They were exceedingly skilful with both axe and
rifle, were expert backwoodsmen, but without physical strength, very childish
and ignorant, vindictive, narrow, and so extremely clannish and tenacious of
their own opinions that they were always an exasperating element to be reckoned
with, in any public matter. We saw also a compact little group of dark small
men, with bright eyes and quick manners. They held close together and chattered
like a lot of magpies. McNally, who had spotted us from afar, informed us that
these were &#8220;keskydees,&#8221; and that they always did stick close
together.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are &#8216;keskydees&#8217;?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what everybody calls them,&#8221; said McNally. &#8220;I
suppose it&#8217;s because they always say it, &#8216;Keskydee, keskydee,&#8217; like
a lot of chickadees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;French!&#8221; cried Johnny, suddenly enlightened. &#8220;<i>Q&#8217;estce
qu&#8217;il dit.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; agreed McNally; &#8220;keskydee. What
does it mean, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is he saying,&#8221; translated Johnny.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>At this time
there were a great many French in California; and for a number of years I could
not quite understand why. Then I learned that most of them were prize winners in
a series of lotteries, called the Lotteries of the Golden Ingot. The prizes were
passages to California, and the lotteries were very popular. The French, or
keskydees, as they were universally called, always went about in gangs, while
the other nationalities were more inclined to amalgamate with the rest of the
community. We saw, also, several &#8220;Dutch Charleys&#8221; who had struck it
rich. They were moon-faced, bland, chuckle-headed looking men, generally with
walrus moustaches, squat and heavy, with fatuous, placid smiles. I suppose they
had no real idea of values, but knew only the difference between having money
and not having money. These prosperous individuals carried two or even more
watches at the ends of long home-made chains constructed of gold nuggets
fastened together with lengths of copper wire. The chains were looped around
their necks, about their shoulders and waists, and hung down in long festoons.
We had three apparently, of these Dutch Charleys, all deadly rivals in
magnificence. They paraded slowly up and down the street, quite satisfied with
themselves, and casting malevolent glances at each other when they passed.</p>

<p>The two gambling places and saloons were hard at it. The low rooms were full
of smoke, and crowded with slowly jostling men. In contrast to the deadly quiet
of such places in San Francisco, these were full of noise and hubbub. The men
moved restlessly, threw down their <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_179'></a>179</span> little bags of dust impatiently, and accepted
victory or defeat with very audible comments. The gamblers, dressed in black,
pale, sat steady-eyed and silent behind their layouts. I suppose the life must
already have developed, if not a type, at least a uniform mental attitude that
showed itself in outward expression. That was, first of all, an intent, quiet
watchfulness; and, secondly, an iron resolution to meet whatever offered. The
gambler must be prepared instantly to shoot; and at the same time he must
realize fully that shooting is going to get him in trouble. For the sympathy of
a mining camp was generally strongly against him when it came to a question of
this sort. We treated ourselves to a drink at the bar, and went outside.</p>

<p>Already the drift of miners was toward the end of the street where a good
sized crowd had gathered. We fell in. Under a large oak tree had been placed a
barrel and several boxes from the store, and on these latter our friend John
Semple, the carpenter, was mounting.</p>

<p>&#8220;John&#8217;s the <i>alcalde</i>,&#8221; McNally explained to us.
&#8220;He&#8217;s the most level-headed man in these diggings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the miners sat down on the ground in front, though some remained
afoot. Semple rapped sharply on the barrel with the muzzle of his revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a miners&#8217; meeting,&#8221; he stated briefly. &#8220;And
we have several things to talk about. Most important thing, &#8217;cordin&#8217; to my
notion, is this row about that big nugget. Seems these yere three men, whose
names I disremember, is partners and is panning down there in the lower
diggings, and while one of them is grubbing around <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span> with a shovel getting ready to fill the
company pan, he sees this yere nugget in the shovel, and annexes it. Now he
claims it&#8217;s his nugget, and the rest of &#8217;em claim it belongs to all
of them as partners. How about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Two men sprang to their feet and began to talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You set down!&#8221; Semple ordered them. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t got
nothing to do with decidin&#8217; this. We&#8217;ll let you know what to do. If
the facts ain&#8217;t right, as I stated &#8217;em, say so; but we don&#8217;t
want no theories out of you. <i>Set down!</i> I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>They subsided, and a silence fell which no one seemed inclined to break.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Semple impatiently, &#8220;come on! Speak up!
Whar&#8217;s all this assorted lot of theories I been hearing in the say-loons
ever since that nugget was turned up?&#8221;</p>

<p>A man with the most extraordinarily ragged garments got to his feet and began
to speak in a pleasant and cultivated voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no solution to offer this company,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I
am, or was, a New York lawyer; and if my knowledge of partnerships will help
any, this is the New York law.&#8221; He sketched briefly the New York rulings
on partnerships, and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Semple cordially.
&#8220;We&#8217;re glad to know how they&#8217;ve figgered it out down thar.
Only trouble, as far as I see, is that they ain&#8217;t usually findin&#8217;
many nuggets down that neck of the woods; so they ain&#8217;t precisely fitted
the case. Anybody know anything nearer to home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I panned in Shirttail Bar last two months,&#8221; blurted <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span> a hoarse and embarrassed
individual, without rising, &#8220;and down thar they had a reg&#8217;lation that airy
nugget that weighs over a half ounce that is found before the dirt is thrown in
the cradle belongs to the man that finds it, and not to the company. Of course
this here is a pan, and not a cradle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more like business. Anybody know if anywhar they do it
the other way around?&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently nobody did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody got any idees as to why we shouldn&#8217;t follow Shirttail in
this matter? Dog-gone you! <i>Set down!</i> You ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; to
say here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man appealed to the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I got a right to be heard in my own case?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;This ain&#8217;t your case,&#8221; persisted John Semple stoutly;
&#8220;it&#8217;s decidin&#8217; what the policy of this camp is goin&#8217; to
be regardin&#8217; nuggets. Your dog-gone case is mighty unimportant and
you&#8217;re a prejudiced party. And if you don&#8217;t set down, I&#8217;ll
come down there and argue with you! If none of you other fellows has anything to
say, we&#8217;ll vote on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We then and there decided, almost unanimously, to follow Shirttail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; resumed Semple, after this matter had been disposed of,
&#8220;there&#8217;s a bunch of these yere keskydees around throwin&#8217;
assorted duckfits all this morning; and as near as I can make out they say
somebody&#8217;s jumped their claim or their camp, or something. Jim,
supposin&#8217; you and your tin star saunter down and eject these
jumpers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>A very tall,
quiet, slow moving man arose, aimed his tobacco juice at a small tree, drawled
out the words, &#8220;All right, Jedge,&#8221; and departed, trailed by a half
dozen jabbering keskydees, to whom he paid not the slightest attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Semple, &#8220;we got a couple of Greasers yere
caught stealin&#8217;. Buck Barry and Missouri Jones caught them at it, so there
ain&#8217;t much use hearin&#8217; witnesses as to the fact. Question is: what
do we want to do with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they steal?&#8221; demanded a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;They just nat&#8217;rally didn&#8217;t steal <i>nothin&#8217;</i>,&#8221;
said a heavy built, square-jawed, clean-shaven man whom I guessed to be Buck
Barry. &#8220;Not while I was around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; persisted the other, &#8220;but what was they
after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, an extry pair of boots, and a shirt, and some tobacco, et
cetery,&#8221; replied Buck Barry contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see them,&#8221; shouted several voices.</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s delay two ragged and furtive Mexicans were dragged
before the assembly. A contemplative silence ensued. Then an elderly man with a
square gray beard spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he deliberately, &#8220;airy man so low down and
shif&#8217;less and miserable as to go to stealin&#8217; boots and shirts and tobacco
in this camp is shore outside my corral. He sure must be a miserable person.
Why&#8217;n hell didn&#8217;t Buck and Missou give him a few lifts with the toes of
their boots, and not come botherin&#8217; us with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Barry and Jones started to reply, but Semple cut them short.</p>

<p>&#8220;They was going to do just that,&#8221; he announced, &#8220;but I
persuaded them to bring this matter up before this meetin&#8217; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span> because we got to begin
to take some measures to stop this kind of a nuisance. There&#8217;s a lot of
undesirables driftin&#8217; into this camp lately. You boys all recall how last
fall we kep&#8217; our dust under our bunks or most anywhere, and felt perfectly
safe about it; but that ain&#8217;t now. A man has to carry his dust right with
him. Now, if we can&#8217;t leave our tents feeling our goods is safe, what do
you expect to do about it? We got to throw the fear of God into the black hearts
of these hounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this juncture Jim, the sheriff, returned and leaned nonchalantly against a
tree, chewing a straw.</p>

<p>Accepting the point of view advanced by the chair, the miners decided that
the two thieves should be whipped and banished from camp. A strong feeling
prevailed that any man who, in this age of plenty, would descend to petty
thieving, was a poor, miserable creature to be pitied. Some charitably inclined
individual actually took up a small collection which was presented to the
thieves after they had received their punishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, <i>vamos</i>, git!&#8221; advised Semple. &#8220;And spread
the glad tidings. We&#8217;ll do the same by any more of you. Well, Jim?&#8221;
he inquired of the sheriff.</p>

<p>Jim shifted his straw from the right corner of his mouth to the left.</p>

<p>&#8220;That outfit don&#8217;t eject worth a cuss,&#8221; said he
laconically.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of them is there?&#8221; asked Semple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two&#8211;and a shotgun,&#8221; stated Jim.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll eject them if we say &#8216;eject&#8217;!&#8221; cried
some one truculently; and several others growled assent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>Jim cast a
humorous eye in that direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I reckon I&#8217;m ekal to the job,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and if
you say &#8216;eject&#8217; again, why out they go. Only when I looked that outfit
over, and saw they was only two of them and six of these jabbering keskydees,
why, I jest nat&#8217;rally wondered whether it was by and according to the peace and
dignity of this camp to mix up in that kind of a muss. I should think they ought
to be capable of doin&#8217; their own ejecting.&#8221;</p>

<p>A discussion arose on this point. The sentiment seemed unanimous that the
Frenchmen ought to have been able to protect themselves, but was divided on the
opinion as to how far the camp was now committed to action.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll think they&#8217;ve bluffed us out, if we drop her
now,&#8221; argued one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought not to be the policy of this camp to mix up with private
quarrels,&#8221; argued the other.</p>

<p>John Semple decided the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like we&#8217;re in the hole,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;and
have got to do something. Now, I tell you what I&#8217;m going to do: I&#8217;m
going to have Jim here give these keskydees blank warrants that they can serve
themselves, and to suit themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>This ingenious solution was very highly commended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unless somebody else has something to bring up, I guess that&#8217;s
about all,&#8221; announced Semple.</p>

<p>&#8220;No inquests?&#8221; some one asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary an inquest. This camp is gettin&#8217; healthy. Adjourned!&#8221;
And the meeting was brought to a formal conclusion by a tap of the pistol on the
empty barrel.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>SUNDAY AT HANGMAN&#8217;S GULCH</span></h2>

<p>It was now about four o&#8217;clock. The crowd dispersed slowly in different
directions, and to its different occupations and amusements. We wandered about,
all eyes and ears. As yet we had not many acquaintances, and could not enter
into the intimate bantering life of the old-timers. There was enough to interest
us, however. A good many were beginning to show the drink. After a long period
of hard labour even the most respectable of the miners would have at times
strange reactions. That is another tale, however; and on this Sunday the
drinking was productive only of considerable noise and boasting. Two old
codgers, head to head, were bragging laboriously of their prowess as cooks. A
small but interested group egged them on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flapjacks?&#8221; enunciated one laboriously; &#8220;flapjacks? Why,
my fren&#8217;, <i>you</i> don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about flapjacks. I
grant you,&#8221; said he, laying one hand on the other&#8217;s arm, &#8220;I
grant ye that maybe, <i>maybe</i>, mind you, you may know about mixin&#8217;
flapjacks, and even about cookin&#8217; flapjacks. But wha&#8217; do you know
about <i>flippin&#8217; flapjacks</i>?&#8221; He removed his hand from the
other&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Nawthin!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Now <i>I</i> am an
exper&#8217;; a real exper&#8217;! When I want to flip a flapjack I just whirl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span> her up through the
chimney and catch her by holdin&#8217; the frying pan out&#8217;n the
window!&#8221;</p>

<p>I found at another point a slender, beardless young chap, with bright black
eyes, and hectic cheeks, engaged in sketching one of the miners who posed before
him. His touch was swift and sure, and his faculty at catching a likeness
remarkable. The sketch was completed and paid for in ten minutes; and he was
immediately besieged by offers from men who wanted pictures of themselves or
their camps. He told me, between strokes of the pencil, that he found this sort
of thing more remunerative than the mining for which he had come to the country,
as he could not stand the necessary hard work. Paper cost him two dollars and a
half a sheet; but that was about all his expense. Alongside the street a very
red-faced, bulbous-nosed and ancient ruin with a patriarchal white beard was
preparing to give phrenological readings. I had seen him earlier in the day, and
had been amused at his impressive glib patter. Now, however, he had become
foolishly drunk. He mounted the same boxes that had served as the executive
desk, and invited custom. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation a burly, red-faced
miner shouldered his way through the group and sat down on the edge of the
boxes.</p>

<p>In the earlier and soberer part of the afternoon the phrenologist had
skilfully steered his way by the safe stars of flattery. Now, as he ran his
hands uncertainly through the miner&#8217;s thick hair, a look of mystification
crept into his bleary eyes. He felt again more carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most &#8217;xtraor&#8217;nary!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Fren&#8217;s,&#8221;
said he, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span> still
feeling at the man&#8217;s head, &#8220;this person has the most extraor&#8217;nary
bump of &#8217;quisitiveness. Never felt one like it, &#8217;xcept on th&#8217; cranium of a
very celebrated thief an&#8217; robber. His bump of benev&#8217;lence &#8217;s a
reg&#8217;lar hole. Bump of truthfulness don&#8217; somehow seem to be there at all.
Bump of cowardice is &#8217;s big &#8217;s an egg. This man,
fren&#8217;s,&#8221; said he, dropping the victim&#8217;s head and advancing
impressively, &#8220;is a very dangerous character. Look out for &#8217;m.
He&#8217;s a liar, an&#8217; a thief, an&#8217; a coward, an&#8217;
a&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you old son of a gun!&#8221; howled the miner, rising to his
feet.</p>

<p>He seized the aged phrenologist, and flung him bodily straight through the
sides of a large tent, and immediately dove after him in pursuit. There came
from that tent a series of crashes, howls of rage and joy, the sounds of violent
scuffling, and then there burst out through the doorway the thoroughly sobered
phrenologist, his white beard streaming over one shoulder, his pop eyes bulging
out, his bulbous nose quite purple, pursued by the angry miner and a score of
the overjoyed populace interrupted in their gambling. Everybody but the two
principals was gasping with laughter. It looked as though the miner might do his
victim a serious injury, so I caught the pursuer, around the shoulders and held
him fast. He struggled violently, but was no match for my bulk, and I restrained
him until he had cooled down somewhat, and had ceased trying to bite and kick
me. Then all at once he laughed, and I released him. Of the phrenologist nothing
remained but a thin cloud of dust hanging in the still air.</p>

<p>Yank and I then thought of going back to camp, and <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span> began to look around after Johnny, who
had disappeared, when McNally rolled up, inviting us to sup with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to go home yet,&#8221; he advised us.
&#8220;Evening&#8217;s the time to have fun. Never mind your friend; he&#8217;s
all right. Now you realize the disadvantage of living way off where you do. My
hang-out is just down the street. Let&#8217;s have a drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>We accepted both his invitations. Then, after the supper, pipes alight, we
sauntered down the street, a vast leisure expanding our horizons. At the street
corner stood a tall, poetic-looking man, with dreamer&#8217;s eyes, a violin
clasped under his chin. He was looking straight past us all out into the dusk of
the piney mountains beyond, his soul in the music he was producing. They were
simple melodies, full of sentiment, and he played as though he loved them.
Within the sound of his bow a dead silence reigned. Men stood with eyes cast
down, their faces sobered, their eyes adream. One burly, reckless, red-faced
individual, who had been bullying it up and down the street, broke into a sob
which he violently suppressed, and then looked about fiercely, as though
challenging any one to have heard. The player finished, tucked his violin and
bow under his arm, and turned away. For a moment the crowd remained motionless,
then slowly dispersed. This was John Kelly, a famous wandering minstrel of the
camps, a strange, shy, poetic man, who never lacked for dust nor for friends,
and who apparently sought for neither.</p>

<p>Under the softening influence of the music the crowd led a better life for
about ten minutes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>We entered the
gambling rooms, of which there were two, and had a drink of what McNally called
&#8220;42 calibre whiskey&#8221; at the bar of each. In one of them we found
Johnny, rather flushed, bucking a faro bank. Yank suggested that he join us, but
he shook his head impatiently, and we moved on. In a tremendous tent made by
joining three or four ordinary tents together, a very lively fiddle and
concertina were in full blast. We entered and were pounced upon by a boisterous
group of laughing men, seized by the shoulders, whirled about, and examined from
behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two gentlemen and a lady!&#8221; roared out one of them.
&#8220;Gentlemen on that side; ladies on this. See-lect your pardners for the
waltz!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a great rushing to and fro in preparation. Men bowed to each other
with burlesque dancing school formality, offered arms, or accepted them with
bearlike coyness. We stood for a moment rather bewildered, not knowing precisely
what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;You belong over that side,&#8221; McNally instructed us. &#8220;I go
over here; I&#8217;m a &#8216;lady.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies,&#8221; explained McNally, &#8220;are those who have patches on
the seats of their pants.&#8221;</p>

<p>As in most social gatherings, we saw that here too the fair sex were in the
majority.</p>

<p>Everybody danced very vigorously, with a tremendous amount of stamping. It
seemed a strenuous occupation after a week of hard work, and yet it was great
fun. Yank pirouetted and balanced and &#8220;sasshayed&#8221; and tom-fooled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span> in a manner
wonderful to behold. We ended flushed and uproarious; and all trooped to the
bar, which, it seemed, was the real reason for the existence of this dance
hall.</p>

<p>The crowd was rough and good natured, full of high spirits, and inclined to
practical jokes of a pretty stiff character. Of course there was the inevitable
bully, swaggering fiercely and truculently back and forth, his belt full of
weapons. Nobody took him very seriously; but, on the other hand, everybody
seemed to take mighty good care not to run definitely counter to him. In the
course of his wanderings he came to our end of the bar, and jostled McNally
aside. McNally was at the moment lighting his pipe, so that in his one hand he
held a burning match and in the other a glass of whiskey. Without the slightest
hurry or excitement, his blue eyes twinkling as humorously as ever, McNally
dumped the whiskey over the bully&#8217;s shock head with his left hand and
touched the match to it with his right. The alcohol sizzled up in a momentary
blue flame, without damage save for a very singed head of hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man on fire! Man on fire!&#8221; yelled McNally. &#8220;Put him
out!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miners rose to the occasion joyously, and &#8220;put him out&#8221; in
the most literal fashion; so that no more was seen of that bully.</p>

<p>About ten o&#8217;clock we were getting tired; and probably the reaction from
the &#8220;42 calibre whiskey&#8221; was making us drowsy. We hunted up Johnny,
still at his faro game; but he positively and impatiently declined to accompany
us. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span> He said he was
ahead&#8211;or behind&#8211;I forget which. I notice both conditions have the
same effect of keeping a man from quitting. We therefore left him, and wandered
home through the soft night, wherein were twinkling stars, gentle breezes,
little voices, and the silhouettes of great trees.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GOLD WASHERS</span></h2>

<p>Johnny did not return at all that night, but showed up next morning at the
diggings, looking blear-eyed and sleepy. He told us he had slept with a friend,
and replied rather curtly that he was a &#8220;little behind the game.&#8221; I
believe myself that he was cleaned out; but that was none of our business. Every
night we divided the dust into five parts. Don Gaspar and Vasquez got two of
these. The remainder we again divided into four. I took charge of Talbot&#8217;s
share. We carried the dust always with us; for the camp was no longer safe from
thieves.</p>

<p>In order to effect this division we had to have some sort of scales. I went
up to the single store to see what I could do. The storekeeper was a drawling,
slow, down-east Yankee, perpetually chewing a long sliver or straw, talking
exclusively through his nose, keen for a bargain, grasping of the last cent in a
trade, and yet singularly interesting and agreeable. His sense of dry humour had
a good deal to do with this. He had no gold scales to lend or to hire, but he
had some to sell. The price was fifteen dollars for an ordinary pair of balances
worth not over a dollar and a half.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll find that cheap, if the miners keep coming <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span> in as fast as they
do,&#8221; said he. &#8220;In two weeks they&#8217;ll be worth fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>We bought them, and obtained from them great satisfaction. Vasquez used to
weigh his gold at night, and again in the morning, in hopes, I suppose, that it
had bred overnight.</p>

<p>Certainly the storekeeper&#8217;s statement as to the influx of miners was
justified. They came every day, in droves. We began to feel quite like
old-timers, and looked with infinite scorn on these greenhorns. They were worse
than we had been; for I have seen them trying to work in the moonlight! The
diggings were actually getting crowded.</p>

<p>It was no longer feasible to dig wherever we pleased to do so. We held many
miners&#8217; meetings, adopting regulations. A claim was to be fifteen feet
square; work must begin on it within ten days; and so forth. Each of the five
members of our party staked out two claims each, on which we worked in turn. All
the old-timers respected these regulations, but some of the newcomers seemed
inclined to dispute them; so that many meetings and much wrangling ensued. The
truth of the matter was that none of us had the slightest permanent interest in
the place. We intended merely to make our piles and to decamp. Each was for
himself. Therefore there was no solidarity. We regulated only when we were
actually forced to it; so that with what we called &#8220;private affairs&#8221;
we declined to interfere. A man could commit any crime in the decalogue if so it
pleased him. His victims must protect themselves. Such things as horse stealing,
grand larceny, claim jumping, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_194'></a>194</span> and mining regulations we dealt with; but other
things were not our affair. We were too busy, and too slightly interested in
what little public welfare a temporary mining camp might have. Even when, in a
few cases, turbulence resulted in shooting, we rarely punished; although,
strangely enough, our innate Anglo-Saxon feeling for the formality of government
always resulted in a Sunday &#8220;inquest.&#8221; We deliberated solemnly. The
verdict was almost invariably &#8220;justifiable self-defence,&#8221; which was
probably near enough, for most of these killings were the result of quarrels.
Murders for the purpose of robbery, later so frequent, were as yet almost
unknown. Twice, however, and in both instances the prisoner was one of the
gamblers, we pronounced judgment. One of these men was banished, and the other
hanged. All in all a very fair semblance of order was kept; but I cannot help
now but feel that our early shirking of responsibility&#8211;which was typical
of all California&#8211;made necessary later great upheavals of popular
justice.</p>

<p>About this time, also, the first of the overland wagon trains began to come
through. Hangman&#8217;s Gulch was not on the direct route; but some
enterprising individual had found our trail fairly practicable for wagons and
ten miles shorter than the regular road. After that many followed, and soon we
had a well-cleared road. They showed plainly the hardships of a long journey,
for the majority of them were thin, sick looking and discouraged. Few of them
stopped at the diggings, although most had come west in hopes of gold, but
pushed on down to the pastures of the Sacramento. They were about worn out <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span> and needed to recuperate
before beginning anything new. Some were out of provisions and practically
starved. The Yankee storekeeper sold food at terrible rates. I remember that
quinine&#8211;a drug much in demand&#8211;cost a dollar a grain! We used to look
up from our diggings at the procession of these sad-faced, lean men walking by
their emaciated cattle, and the women peering from the wagons, and be very
thankful that we had decided against the much-touted overland route.</p>

<p>One day, however, an outfit went through of quite a different character. We
were apprised of its approach by a hunter named Bagsby. He loped down the trail
to the river level very much in a hurry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;quit work! Come see what&#8217;s
coming down the trail!&#8221; with which he charged back again up the hill.</p>

<p>His great excitement impressed us, for Bagsby, like most of the old-time
Rocky Mountain men, was not ordinarily what one would call an emotional
individual. Therefore we dropped our tools and surged up the hill as fast as we
could go. I think we suspected Indians.</p>

<p>A train of three wagons drawn by strong oxen was lurching slowly down the
road. It differed little from others of its kind, save that the cattle were in
better shape and the men walking alongside, of the tall, competent backwoodsman
type, seemed well and hearty. But perhaps a hundred yards ahead of the leading
wagon came a horse&#8211;the only horse in the outfit&#8211;and on it, riding
side-saddle, was a girl. She was a very pretty, red-cheeked girl, and she must
have stopped within a half mile or so of the camp <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span> in order to get herself up for this
impressive entrance. Her dress was of blue calico with a white yoke and heavy
flounces or panniers; around her neck was a black velvet ribbon; on her head was
a big leghorn hat with red roses. She rode through the town, her head high, like
a princess; and we all cheered her like mad. Not once did she look at us; but I
could see her bosom heaving with excitement beneath her calico, and her nostrils
wide. She was a remarkably pretty girl; and this was certainly the moment of her
triumph.</p>

<p>We fell into sanity as respects our hours of work and the way we went at it.
Often we took as much as an hour and a half off at noon; or quit work early in
the day. Then it was pleasant to sit with other miners under the trees or in the
shade by the stream swapping yarns, doing our mending or washing, and generally
getting acquainted. As each man&#8217;s product was his own, no one cared how
much or how little the others worked. Simply when he quit, his share ceased.
This does not mean that we shirked our work, however; we merely grew to be a
little sensible.</p>

<p>Some of our discussions were amusing, and several of them most illuminating.
Thus, one day, John Semple summed up a long talk in which the conversation had
swung wildly among the ideas of what each would do when he had dug
&#8220;enough&#8221; gold. That had led us to consider what amount we thought
would be &#8220;enough&#8221; for each of us. John settled it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is always a little more than a man
has.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>The political
situation was fruitful of much idle discussion also. California had not been
formally placed on any footing whatever by the United States Congress. Whatever
any community did in the way of legislation or regulation was extra-legal and
subject to ratification. I have heard grave discussions as to whether even
murder could be considered a crime, since in this no-man&#8217;s land there was
no real law forbidding it!</p>

<p>A good many Chinese drifted in about this time, and established a camp of
their own a short distance downstream. We took some pride in them as
curiosities, with their queer, thatchlike hats, their loose blue clothing, their
pigtails wound tight around their heads, and their queer yellow faces. They were
an unobtrusive people, scratching away patiently, though spasmodically, on the
surface of the ground. We sometimes strolled down to see them. They were very
hospitable, and pleased at the interest they excited.</p>

<p>We made from fourteen to seventeen ounces of gold dust a day for some weeks,
working our two cradles something like eight hours a day. With gold at the then
current rate of fourteen dollars an ounce this was a good return, and we were
quite happy. Besides, we were always hoping for a big strike. One day, as I was
in the very act of turning my shovelful of dirt into the cradle, my eye caught a
dull gleam. I instantly deflected the motion to dump the dirt on the stones
alongside, fished about, and dug out a nugget that weighed three and
three-quarter ounces. This was by far the largest single nugget found in these
diggings&#8211;for most of the gold here came in flakes&#8211;and it attracted
much attention. It belonged to me, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_198'></a>198</span> individually, because I had not yet dumped it into
the cradle.</p>

<p>About this time we had to come to some sort of a decision, for our provisions
were about exhausted. We had no desire to replenish our stock from that of the
local storekeeper. We were doing pretty well in the diggings, but we had also
fairly healthy appetites, and I am convinced that at the prices that man charged
we should have no more than kept even. Williams, the storekeeper, was levying
double profits, one from us, and one from the overland immigrants. Don Gaspar
proposed we send out Vasquez with all the horses to restock at
Sutter&#8217;s Fort. We were a trifle doubtful as to whether Vasquez would ever
come back, but Don Gaspar seemed to have confidence in his man. Finally, though
a little doubtfully, we came to the plan. Don Gaspar sent out also to McClellan
for safekeeping his accumulations of gold dust; but we did not go quite that
far. In view of probable high prices we entrusted him with eighteen ounces for
the purchase of goods.</p>

<p>While he was away we came to another decision. It had been for some weeks
preparing. The diggings were becoming overcrowded. Almost every foot of the bar
was occupied, and more men were coming in every day. No longer could the
newcomer be sure of his colour the afternoon of his arrival; but was forced to
prospect here and there up and down the river until he found a patch of the pay
dirt. Most trusted simply to luck, but some had systems on which they worked. I
have seen divining rods used. The believers in chance seemed to do as well as
any one else.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>But, also, our
own yield was decreasing. The last week we had gained only nineteen ounces all
told. This might be merely a lean bit of misfortune, or it might mean that we
had taken the best from our ten claims. Since the human mind is prone to
changes, we inclined to the latter theory. We were getting restless. No miner
ever came to California who did not believe firmly that he would have done much
better had he come out one voyage earlier; and no miner ever found diggings so
rich that he had not a sneaking suspicion that he could do even better &#8220;a
little farther on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our restlessness was further increased by the fact that we were now seeing a
good deal of Sam Bagsby, the hunter. He and Yank had found much in common, and
forgathered of evenings before our campfire.</p>

<p>Bagsby was a man of over fifty, tall and straight as a youngster, with a
short white beard, a gray eye, and hard, tanned flesh. He was a typical Rocky
Mountain man, wearing even in the hottest weather his fur cap with the tail
hanging behind, his deerskin moccasins, and his fringed buckskin hunting shirt.
Mining possessed no interest for him whatever. He was by profession a trapper,
and he had crossed the plains a half-dozen times.</p>

<p>&#8220;No mining for me!&#8221; he stated emphatically. &#8220;I paddled
around after the stuff for a while, till my hands swelled up like p&#8217;ison, and my
back creaked like a frozen pine tree in the wind. Then I quit, and I stayed
quit. I&#8217;m a hunter; and I&#8217;m makin&#8217; a good livin&#8217;,
because I ain&#8217;t very particular on how I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>He and Yank smoked interminable pipes, and swapped <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span> yarns. Johnny and I liked nothing
better than to keep quiet and listen to them. Bagsby had come out with Captain
Sutter; and told of that doughty soldier&#8217;s early skirmishes with the
Indians. His tales of the mountains, the plains, and the game and Indians were
so much romance to us; and we both wished heartily that fate could have allowed
us a chance at such adventures.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t you fellows branch out?&#8221; Bagsby always
ended. &#8220;What do you want to stick here for like a lot of groundhogs?
There&#8217;s rivers back in the hills a heap better than this one, and nobody
thar. You&#8217;d have the place plumb to yoreselves. Git in where the mountains
is really mountainous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he would detail at length and slowly his account of the great mountains,
deep cañons, the shadows of forests, ridges high up above the world, and gorges
far within the bowels of the earth through which dashed white torrents. We
gathered and pieced together ideas of great ice and snow mountains, and
sun-warmed bars below them, and bears and deer, and a high clear air breathing
through a vast, beautiful and solitary wilderness. The picture itself was enough
to set bounding the pulses of any young man, with a drop of adventure in his
veins. But also Bagsby was convinced that there we should find richer diggings
than any yet discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It stands to reason,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;that the farther up you
git, the more gold there is. All this loose stuff yere is just what washed down
from the main supply. If you boys reely wants rich diggings, then you want to
push up into the Porcupine River country.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>But with this
glowing and vivid impression we gathered another: that of a trackless
wilderness, fearful abysses down which to find a way, labyrinthine defiles,
great forests. None of us knew how to cope with these things. Yank, the best
woodsman of us all, had had no experience in mountains. None of us knew anything
of Indian warfare. None of us had the least idea that we could find Porcupine
River, even if we were to be given accurate directions on how to get there.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the idea with us had been growing. Some of the bolder spirits
among our acquaintances used to talk it over with us at odd times&#8211;McNally,
Buck Barry, and his partner, Missouri Jones. We did not discuss it as a plan,
hardly as a possibility, merely as a pleasant theme. We found, and advanced any
amount of objections&#8211;the uncertainty of finding any gold at all, the
expense of such a journey, the danger from Indians, the fact that we could find
other proved diggings much nearer, and a half hundred others. The moment one of
us had advanced one of these objections he was at once himself the most eager to
demolish it. Thus we gradually worked ourselves toward enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Sam Bagsby would join us, it might be worth trying,&#8221; we came
to at last.</p>

<p>But Sam Bagsby scouted any such idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t that kind of a tom-fool,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If I
want to paddle my hands blue I&#8217;d do it yere. I couldn&#8217;t make
more&#8217;n a living anyway. I tell you I ain&#8217;t got no use for yore
pra&#8217;rie dog grubbing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then McNally had an inspiration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>&#8220;Will you
go, Sam, if we pay you for going?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; replied the trapper at once. &#8220;I&#8217;m a labouring
man, I&#8217;ll go anywhar I&#8217;m paid to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>It came out that Bagsby&#8217;s ideas of proper compensation were his
supplies, fifteen dollars a week in gold, and a drink of whiskey twice a day! In
all this gold country he was the only man I met who genuinely despised money. I
really think we were hurried to our decision by this unexpected reasonableness
on his part. At any rate we decided definitely to go.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>WE LEAVE THE DIGGINGS</span></h2>

<p>There were nine of us&#8211;Bagsby, Yank, Johnny Fairfax, myself, Don Gaspar,
Vasquez, McNally, Buck Barry, and Missouri Jones. We possessed, in all, just
nine horses. Yank, Vasquez, Bagsby, and Jones drove eight of them out again to
Sutter&#8217;s Fort for provisions&#8211;Don Gaspar&#8217;s beautiful chestnut
refused to be a pack-horse on any terms. We took the opportunity of sending our
accumulations of gold dust to Talbot for safekeeping. I do not know just how
much my companions forwarded. Of course I could compute their shares; but had no
means of telling just what deductions to allow for the delights of
Hangman&#8217;s Gulch. For Talbot I laid aside as his share of our entire
product of four hundred and eighty-six ounces a total of one hundred and ten
ounces. This included the half of my own share, as agreed. Roughly speaking, the
value of a partnership third, after Don Gaspar&#8217;s portion had been
deducted, was a trifle over a thousand dollars for six weeks&#8217; work. There
seemed to us also an excellent chance to realize something on the two cradles. I
went about among the miners, and without trouble got bids for a hundred dollars
each. Johnny was by no means satisfied with this. He insisted that late in the
afternoon we drag the formidable engines up the trail to the town, where he
deposited them in the middle <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span> of the street. There he proceeded to auction them;
attracting the crowd by the simple expedient of firing his Colt&#8217;s
revolver. The bidding was sluggish at first, but Johnny&#8217;s facetious
oratory warmed it. The first cradle was knocked down at one hundred and sixty
dollars. The second was about to go for approximately the same amount, when
Johnny held up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he impressively, &#8220;I do not think you
quite realize that for what you are bidding. This is no ordinary cradle, like
the other. This is the very identical warranted genuine cradle into which that
enormous lump of gold, weighing three and three-quarter ounces&#8211;the finest
nugget ever unearthed at Hangman&#8217;s Gulch&#8211;was <i>about to be</i>
shovelled by that largest and most enormous lump of a lad, the gentleman at my
right, when seized upon and claimed as private property in accordance with the
laws of these diggings. This is the very identical historical cradle! Now, how
much am I bid!&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd laughed&#8211;but it bid! We got two hundred and forty dollars for
it.</p>

<p>Our purveyors returned the second day after. They reported prices very high
at Sutter&#8217;s Fort, and a great congestion of people there; both of those
ascending the river from San Francisco, and of overlanders. Prices had
consequently gone up. Indeed, so high were all provisions that our hard-headed
partners had contented themselves with buying only some coffee, dried beef, and
flour. They had purchased also a further supply of powder and balls, and a rifle
apiece for such of us as already had none. The weapons were very expensive; and
we found <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span> that our
savings had been much eaten into. We collected our effects, packed them, as many
of them as we were able, and sunk to sleep in a pleasing tingle of
excitement.</p>

<p>Bagsby got us up long before daylight. The air was chilly, in contrast to the
terrific heats to be expected later in the day, so we hastened to finish our
packing, and at dawn were off.</p>

<p>Bagsby struck immediately away from the main road toward the north. The
country we traversed was one of wide, woody bottoms separated by rocky hills.
The trapper proved to be an excellent guide. Seemingly by a sort of instinct he
was able to judge where a way would prove practicable for our animals down into
or up out of the numerous cañons and ravines. It was borne in on me very
forcibly how much hampered we should have been by our inexperience had we tried
it alone. The country mounted gradually. From some of the higher points we could
see out over the lowlands lost in a brown heat-haze. Deer were numerous, and a
species of hare, and the helmeted quail. The sun was very hot; but the air was
curiously streaked with coolness and with a fierce dry heat as though from an
opened furnace door. All the grass was brown and crisp. Darker and more abrupt
mountains showed themselves in the distance, with an occasional peak of white
and glittering snow.</p>

<p>Until about three o&#8217;clock we journeyed through a complete solitude.
Then we came upon some men digging in a dry wash. They had piled up a great heap
of dirt from a hole. We stopped and talked to them; and discovered that they
were working what they called &#8220;dry diggings.&#8221; The <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span> pay dirt they excavated
from wherever they found it piled it in a convenient place, and there left it
until the rains should permit its washing. They claimed their dirt would prove
to be very rich; but I thought myself that they were labouring in great faith.
Also we learned what Bagsby had known right along, but which he had not bothered
to tell us; that we were now about to cross the main Overland Trail.</p>

<p>We stopped that night near the road, and at a wayside inn or road house of
logs kept by a most interesting man. He served us an excellent meal, including
real eggs, and afterward joined us around the fire. He was an Italian, short,
strongly built, with close curly hair, a rollicking, good-natured face, and with
tiny gold rings in his ears. Johnny and he did most of the talking, while we
listened. No part of the civilized world seemed to have been unvisited by this
pair. Johnny mentioned Paris, our host added an intimate detail as to some
little street; London appeared to be known to them from one end to the other;
Berlin, Edinburgh, St. Petersburg even; and a host of other little fellows whose
names I never knew before and cannot remember now. They swapped reminiscences of
the streets; the restaurants, and the waiters and proprietors thereof; the
alleys and byways, the parks and little places. I knew, in a general way, that
Johnny had done the grand tour; but the Italian with his gold earrings and his
strong, brown, good-humoured peasant face puzzled me completely. How came he to
be so travelled? so intimately travelled? He was no sailor; that I soon
determined.</p>

<p>The two of them became thoroughly interested; but <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span> after a time the native courtesy of the
Italian asserted itself. He evidently thought we might feel left out of it;
though I think the others were, like myself, quite fascinated.</p>

<p>&#8220;You lika music?&#8221; he smiled at us engagingly. &#8220;I getta my
Italian fiddle? No?&#8221;</p>

<p>He arose at our eager assent, pushed aside a blanket that screened off one
end of the log cabin, and produced his &#8220;Italian fiddle&#8221;&#8211;a
hand-organ!</p>

<p>At once the solution of the wide wandering among the many cities, the
intimate knowledge of streets and of public places burst upon my comprehension.
I could see our host looking upward, his strong white teeth flashing in an
ingratiating fascinating smile, his right arm revolving with the crank of his
organ, his little brown monkey with the red coat and the anxious face
clambering&#x2500;</p>

<p>Next morning we crossed the Overland Trail, and plunged into a new country of
pines, of high hills, of deep cañons, and bold, rocky ridges. The open spaces we
had left behind, and the great heats. Water flowed in almost every ravine, and
along its courses grew green grass and wild flowers. Every little while we would
come upon openings in the forest, clear meadows spangled with blossoms; or
occasionally we would skirt high bald knobs of rock around which was stiff
brush. For some miles we could journey at ease through clear woods, then would
encounter a gash in the earth into which, at some expense of trial, we would
have to find a way. At first every stream bed was dotted with the red shirts of
miners. They became fewer as we advanced, until finally the last pair had been
left behind. We camped that night at the edge of one of the meadows, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span> beneath pine trees. The
air turned very chilly. We built ourselves a fire of dried branches from the
trees. In the meadow the horses cropped eagerly at the lush green feed, their
bells tinkling pleasantly.</p>

<p>Nothing more remote could be imagined. Nevertheless Bagsby, Don Gaspar, and
Vasquez were not satisfied. They consulted at length and apart; then Bagsby
announced that sentries must stand watches. We grumbled at this, but Bagsby was
firm, and as we had agreed to obey his commands we did so now. Don Gaspar
explained to us later that the Mexican thieves would trail a party like ours for
days, awaiting the chance to make off with the horses. Bagsby also chose the
sentinels, selecting himself, Yank, Vasquez, and Missouri Jones. Once wrapped in
my warm blanket I found myself selfishly glad that my experience had not been
considered worth trusting.</p>

<p>The third day we occupied in surmounting a tremendous ridge of mountains. We
climbed for hours, working our way up by zigzag and long slants through the
pines, the rocky outcrops, the ledges, and the stiff brush that made up the
slope. It was hard work; and it seemed to have no end. We arrived at last on a
knife-edge summit. Here the trees were fewer. We looked abroad over the country
we had traversed, and that which lay before us&#8211;a succession of dark, dim,
undulating ridges with cañons and valleys between, slanting from the great
ranges at the right to brown rolling hills and the heat-covered, half-guessed
plains. Immediately below us, very far down, was a toy-like valley, with low
hills, and flat places, and groves of elfin trees, and a twisting bottle green
river with white rapids.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_209'></a>209</span>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s the Porcupine,&#8221; Bagsby
told us briefly.</p>

<p>We took a look, then plunged into the tangles and difficulties of the
descent. Just at sundown, our knees bending under us, we came off that terrific
slant to a grateful wide flat, grown with scattered oaks, and covered with fine
brown grass. A little spring stream wandered through the meadow toward the river
on the other side of the valley.</p>

<p>We camped right there, dumping the packs from the horses almost anyhow. After
a hearty meal, we rolled ourselves immediately into our blankets and fell into a
grateful sleep to the tune of the distant river murmuring over the shingle.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span><a id='link_22'></a>CHAPTER XXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STRIKE</span></h2>

<p>We awoke next morning to a bright day. The helmeted quail were calling; the
bees were just beginning a sun-warmed hum among the bushes; a languorous warmth
hung in the air, and a Sunday stillness. It was as though we awakened to a new
world, untrodden by men; which was, indeed, a good deal the case.</p>

<p>While we ate breakfast we discussed our plans. The first necessity, of
course, was to find out about gold. To that end we agreed to separate for the
day, prospecting far and wide. Bagsby kept camp, and an eye on the horses. He
displayed little interest in the gold proposition; but insisted strongly that we
should carry both our rifles and revolvers.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the thrill of anticipation with which I set
off up the valley. The place was so new, so untouched, so absolutely unknown.
The high ridges on either side frowned down austerely on the little meadows that
smiled back quite unabashed. As I crossed the brown dry meadow toward the river
a covey of quail whirred away before me, lit, and paced off at a great rate. Two
big grouse roared from a thicket.</p>

<p>The river was a beautiful, clear stream, with green wavery water whirling
darkly in pools, or breaking white <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_211'></a>211</span> among the stones. As my shadow fell upon it, I
caught a glimpse of a big trout scurrying into the darkness beneath a boulder.
Picking my way among the loose stones I selected a likely place on the bar and
struck home my pick.</p>

<p>I have since repeated the sensations of that day&#8211;on a smaller scale of
course&#8211;in whipping untried trout waters; same early excitement and
enthusiasm, same eager sustained persistence in face of failure, same
incredulous slowing down, same ultimate discouragement, disbelief and disgust.
All that day I shovelled and panned. The early morning freshness soon
dissipated. Between the high mountain walls the heat reflected. All the quail
stood beneath the shade of bushes, their beaks half open as though panting. The
birds that had sung so sweetly in the early morning had somewhere sought repose.
I could occasionally catch glimpses of our horses dozing under trees. Even the
chirping insects were still. As far as I could make out I was the only living
thing foolish enough to stay abroad and awake in that suffocating heat. The
sweat dripped from me in streams; my eyes ached from the glare of the sun on the
rocks and the bleached grasses. Toward the close of the afternoon I confessed
sneakingly to myself that I was just a little glad I had found no gold and that
I hoped the others had been equally unfortunate. The thought of working day
after day in that furnace heat was too much for me.</p>

<p>My hopes were fulfilled. All came in that night tired, hot, dirty, and
discouraged. Not one of the eight of us had raised a sign of colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bagsby philosophically, &#8220;that&#8217;s all
right. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span> We&#8217;ve
just got to go higher. To-morrow we&#8217;ll move upstream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly next day we turned at right angles to our former route and
followed up the bed of the cañon ten or twelve miles toward the distant main
ranges. It was, in general, rather hard scrabbling for the horses, though we
footmen did well enough. Sometimes we crossed wide flats, resembling the one we
had just left; again, where the cañon narrowed, we had actually to stumble in
the rocks of the stream bed. Twice we forded, and twice we had to make great
climbs up and down again in order to get by points that came boldly down to the
river. It was curious to see the nature of the country change. The pines on the
mountains to our right and left seemed to push down nearer to our level; the
grass turned green; the stream narrowed and became swifter; the sky seemed to
turn bluer; and from the ranges breathed a cool, refreshing wind.</p>

<p>About four o&#8217;clock we camped. The flat was green; little clumps of
cedar pushed out across it; the oaks had given place to cottonwoods; we had now
to make acquaintance with new birds. But what particularly interested us was the
fact that at this point the high cañon walls at either side broke into rounder
hills that opened out widely, and that from among them descended many ravines,
barrancas, and dry washes.</p>

<p>The following morning we went prospecting again. My instructions were for the
dry washes in the sides of the hills. Accordingly I scrambled up among the
boulders in the nearest V-shaped ravine. I had hardly to look at all. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span> Behind a large boulder
lay a little cuplike depression of stones in which evidently had stood a
recently evaporated pool of water, and which, in consequence, was free from the
usual dusty rubble. In the interstices between the stones my eye caught a dull
glitter. I fell on my knees, dug about with the point of my bowie knife, and so
unearthed small nuggets aggregating probably a half ounce in weight.</p>

<p>Although mightily tempted to stay for more, I minded our agreement to report
promptly the first discovery, and started back to camp. Why I did not come a
header in that fearful, boulder-strewn wash I cannot tell you. Certainly I took
no care of my going, but leaped recklessly from rock to rock like a goat. When I
reached the flat, I ran, whooping like an Indian. From the river I could see
Johnny and Buck Barry running, too, and had sense enough to laugh as it occurred
to me they must think us attacked by Indians. Far down the stream I could just
make out figures I knew to be Yank and McNally. They too seemed to be coming to
camp, though I could not imagine that my shouts had carried so far.</p>

<p>I burst in on Bagsby, who was smoking his pipe and leisurely washing the
breakfast dishes, with a whoop, lifted him bodily by the shoulders, whirled him
around in a clumsy dance. He aimed a swipe at me with the wet dish cloth that
caught me across the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You tarnation young grizzly b&#8217;ar!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>I wiped the water from my eyes. Johnny and Buck Barry ran up. Somehow they
did not seem to be anticipating an Indian attack after all. Johnny ran up to
thump me on the back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_214'></a>214</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it <i>great</i>!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Right off the reel! First pop! Bagsby, old sport, you&#8217;re a
wonder!&#8221; He started for Bagsby, who promptly rushed for his long
rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill the first lunatic I see,&#8221; he
announced.</p>

<p>Johnny laughed excitedly, and turned back to thump me again.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you guess what it was?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t. Just blundered on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; I yelled. &#8220;Have you struck it, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First shovel,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t
mean&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>I thrust my three nuggets under his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; broke in Buck Barry, &#8220;if you fellows know where the
whiskey is, hide it, and hide it quick. If I see it, I&#8217;ll get
drunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yank and McNally at this moment strolled from around the bushes. We all burst
out on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;See your fool nuggets and &#8216;colour,&#8217; and raise you this,&#8221;
drawled Yank, and he hauled from his pocket the very largest chunk of virgin
gold it has ever been my good fortune to behold. It was irregular in shape,
pitted and scored, shaped a good deal like an egg, and nearly its size. One
pound and a tiny fraction that great nugget balanced&#8211;when we got around to
weighing it. And then to crown the glorious day which the gods were brimming for
us, came Don Gaspar and Vasquez, trailed by that long and saturnine individual,
Missouri Jones. The Spaniards were outwardly calm, but their eyes snapped. As
soon as they saw us they waved their hats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! also you have found the gold!&#8221; cried Don Gaspar, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span> sensing immediately the
significance of our presence. &#8220;We, too. It is of good colour; there above
by the bend.&#8221; His eye widened as he saw what Yank held. &#8220;<i>Madre de
dios!</i>&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>McNally, who had said and done nothing, suddenly uttered a resounding whoop
and stood on his hands. Missouri Jones, taking aim, spat carefully into the
centre of the fire, missing the dishpan by a calculated and accurate inch.</p>

<p>&#8220;The country is just <i>lousy</i> with gold,&#8221; he pronounced.</p>

<p>Then we blew up. We hugged each other, we pounded each other&#8217;s backs,
we emulated McNally&#8217;s wild Irish whoops, finally we joined hands and
danced around and around the remains of the fire, kicking up our heels absurdly.
Bagsby, a leathery grin on his face, stood off one side. He still held his
long-barrelled rifle, which he presented at whoever neared him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, look out!&#8221; he kept saying over and over.
&#8220;I&#8217;m shootin&#8217; lunatics to-day; and apparently there&#8217;s
plenty game to choose from.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span><a id='link_23'></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CAMP ON THE PORCUPINE</span></h2>

<p>We should all have liked to start right in digging, but Bagsby strenuously
opposed this.</p>

<p>&#8220;You-all have a rich diggings yere,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and you want
to stay a while and git the most there is out of them. And if you&#8217;re going
to do that, you&#8217;ve got to get a good ready. You&#8217;ve got make a decent
camp, and a stockade for the hosses at night; and if you want yore grub to last
you more than a month there&#8217;s got to be some reg&#8217;lar hunting and fishing
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll take a week!&#8221; cried Johnny impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or more,&#8221; agreed Bagsby with entire complacence. &#8220;You can
bull at it and go to t&#8217;aring up the scenery if you want to; but you won&#8217;t
last long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unpalatable as this advice seemed, with all the loose gold lying about, we
ended by adopting it. Indeed, we added slightly to our self-imposed tasks by
determining on the construction of cradles. Yank had figured out a scheme having
to do with hollowed logs and canvas with cleats that would obviate the need of
lumber. We deputed Johnny to help him. Bagsby and Vasquez were to hunt and fish
for the general benefit, while the rest of us put up a stockade, or corral, and
erected a cabin.</p>

<p>I must confess the labour was pleasant. We had plenty <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span> of axes, and four of us were skilled in
their use. Personally I like nothing better than the exercise of swinging a keen
blade, the feeling of skillful accuracy and of nicely adjusted effort. We felled
dozens, hundreds, of tall young pines eight inches to a foot in diameter, and
planted them upright in a trench to form a stockade. Then we ran up a rough sort
of cabin of two rooms. Yank, somewhat hampered by Johnny, finished his cradles,
and turned in to help us. Bagsby and Vasquez brought in several deer and an elk,
and trapped many quail and hares. We fared royally, worked healthfully in the
shade of our trees, and enjoyed huge smokes and powwows around our fire of an
evening. Every night we drove the horses within the enclosure; and slept
heavily.</p>

<p>Always in the background of consciousness lay the gold, the incredibly
abundant gold. It coloured our dreams, it gilded our labour. As we drew to the
end of our construction work, I really believe we experienced a slight, a very
slight, feeling of regret that this fine flavour of anticipation was so nearly
at an end. However, I noticed that though we completed the house at three of the
afternoon, we none of us showed any disposition to wait for the morrow. We
promptly lugged one of Yank&#8217;s log cradles to the border of the stream and
put in two hours washing.</p>

<p>The results were most encouraging, for we gained in that short time nearly
two ounces of flake gold.</p>

<p>That evening we reviewed our situation carefully. The older heads of the
party&#8211;Yank, Bagsby, Don Gaspar, and Missouri Jones&#8211;overruled our
young desire to jump into things headlong.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>&#8220;If this
camp is going to get on right,&#8221; said Yank, &#8220;we got to make some
provision for working right. Somebody&#8217;s got to be in camp all the time,
that&#8217;s sure&#8211;to cook some decent meals, do the odd chores, and keep
an eye on the stock.&#8221; Bagsby nodded emphatically at this. &#8220;And
somebody&#8217;s got to rustle game and fish. Yere&#8217;s nine husky men to
eat. If we leave one man in camp and two to hunt, we have six left for gold
washing. That&#8217;s three to a cradle, and that&#8217;s just right.&#8221;</p>

<p>We came to that, too; and so settled into our routine. Bagsby was the only
permanent office-holder among us. He was unanimously elected the official
hunter. The rest of us agreed to take turn about at the other jobs. It was
further agreed to increase our chances by utilizing the cradles at two totally
different kinds of diggings. One we located on the bar to wash out the shingle.
The other we carried to a point opposite the dry ravine in which I had found my
three little nuggets.</p>

<p>Don Gaspar had worked like a nailer at the construction although he was
utterly unskilled. Now at the end of the week he was worn out, although he
stoutly maintained he was as good as ever. This high-bred, energetic gentleman
we had all come to admire, both for his unfailing courtesy and his uncomplaining
acceptance of hardships to which evidently he had never been accustomed. Exactly
why he underwent the terrible exertions incidental to gold finding I have never
quite fathomed. I do not believe he needed money; and I never saw one of his
race fond of hard physical work. Indeed, he was the only member of his class I
ever met who would work. The truth of the matter probably <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span> lies somewhere between an outcropping
of the old adventurous <i>conquistadore</i> spirit and the fascination of the
golden metal itself, quite apart from its dollars-and-cents value. Unanimously
we voted in Don Gaspar as camp keeper for the first week. We wanted to give him
a rest; but I do not think we pleased him. However, he bowed to our decision
with his usual gracious courtesy. As hunting companion for Bagsby we appointed
Missouri Jones, with the understanding that every two days that office was to
have a new incumbent. Johnny, McNally, and I took charge of the dry wash, and
the rest of the party tackled the bar. Of course we all&#8211;except
Bagsby&#8211;were to share equally.</p>

<p>Unless the wash should prove very productive we would have the worst end of
it, for we had to carry the pay dirt down to the stream&#8217;s edge. For the
purpose we used the pack-sacks&#8211;or <i>alforjas</i>, as the Spaniards call
them. Each held about sixty or seventy pounds of dirt. We found this a sweaty
and stumbly task&#8211;to stagger over the water-smoothed boulders of the wash,
out across the shingle to the edge of the stream. There one of us dumped his
burden into the cradle; and we proceeded to wash it out. We got the
&#8220;colour&#8221; at once in the residuary black sand.</p>

<p>All morning we laboured manfully, and discovered a brand new set of muscles.
By comparison our former toil of mere digging and washing seemed light and
pleasurable exercise.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this stuff don&#8217;t run pretty high,&#8221; grunted McNally,
wiping the sweat from his eyes, &#8220;it&#8217;s me voting for the bar. We
can&#8217;t stand all day of this.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>He heaved the
contents of his pack-sack into the cradle, and shook it disgustedly. Suddenly
his jaw dropped and his eye widened with so poignant an expression that we both
begged him, in alarm, to tell us what was the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, will you look at that!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>We followed the direction of his gaze, but saw only the meadow, and the
horses feeding in it, and the thin smoke beyond, where Don Gaspar was bending
his proud Castilian spirit to attend to fried steak and flapjacks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at those horses!&#8221; cried McNally with growing
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with them?&#8221; cried Johnny and I in a
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matter with them! Nothing!&#8221; cried McNally with comical disgust.
&#8220;The matter&#8217;s with us.&#8221; He rapped his knuckles on his head.
&#8220;Solid, all the way through!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Why, save from nat&#8217;ral
born human imbelicity, should horses be living like gentlemen while gentlemen
are working like horses!&#8221;</p>

<p>We took the hint. That afternoon we saddled the pack-horses and led them,
laden with the dirt, back and forth between the ravine and the cradle.</p>

<p>All of us worked until rather later in the day than usual.... The hunters,
too, did not return until dark. We weighed the results of our labour with eager
interest. From our cradle we had taken eleven ounces, while those working the
bar had gained just over nine. That was a good day&#8217;s work, and we were
much elated.</p>

<p>&#8220;And most any time,&#8221; exulted Johnny, &#8220;we&#8217;ll run into
a big pocket with thousands.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span><a id='link_24'></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE INDIANS</span></h2>

<p>Although we did not immediately run into the expected thousands, nor did the
promise of that first glorious day of discovery quite fulfil itself,
nevertheless our new diggings turned out to be very rich. We fell into routine;
and the days and weeks slipped by. Bagsby and one companion went out every day
to hunt or to fish. We took turns at a vacation in camp. Every night we
&#8220;blew&#8221; our day&#8217;s collection of sand, weighed the gold, and
packed it away. Our accumulations were getting to be very valuable.</p>

<p>For a month we lived this idyllic life quite unmolested, and had gradually
come to feel that we were so far out of the world that nothing would ever
disturb us. The days seemed all alike, clear, sparkling, cloudless. It was my
first experience with the California climate, and these things were a perpetual
wonder to my New England mind.</p>

<p>Then one day when I was camp keeper, at the upper end of our long meadow, a
number of men emerged from the willows and hesitated uncertainly. They were too
far away to be plainly distinguishable, but I believed in taking no chances, so
I fired my revolver to attract the attention of my companions. They looked up
from their labour, saw the men, and promptly came into camp.</p>

<p>The group still hesitated at the edge of the thicket. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span> Then one of them waved something white.
We waved in return; whereupon they advanced slowly in our direction.</p>

<p>As they neared we saw them to be Indians. Their leader held before him a
stick to which had been tied a number of white feathers. As they approached us
they began to leap and dance to the accompaniment of a weird rising and falling
chant. They certainly did not look very formidable, with their heterogeneous
mixture of clothing, their round, black, stupid faces and their straight hair.
Most of them were armed simply with bows and arrows, but three carried specimens
of the long Spanish musket.</p>

<p>Buck Barry promptly sallied out to meet them, and shook hands with the
foremost. They then advanced to where we were gathered and squatted on the
ground. They were certainly a villainous and dirty looking lot of savages,
short, thickset, round faced, heavy featured, with coarse, black, matted hair
and little twinkling eyes. A more brutish lot of human beings I had never seen;
and I was almost deceived into thinking them too stupid to be dangerous. The
leaders had on remnants of civilized clothing, but the rank and file were
content with scraps of blanket, old ragged coats, single shirts, and the like.
The oldest man produced a long pipe from beneath his blanket, filled it with a
few grains of coarse tobacco, lighted it by means of a coal from our fire,
puffed twice on it, and passed it to me. I perforce had to whiff at it also,
though the necessity nearly turned my stomach. I might next have given it to one
of our own party, but I did not want to deprive him <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span> of my own first hand sensation, so I
handed it back to another of the visitors for fresh inoculation, as it were.
Evidently I had by accident hit on acceptable etiquette, as deep grunts of
satisfaction testified. After we had had a whiff all around, the chief opened
negotiations in Spanish. Most of us by now had learned enough of it from our
intercourse with Don Gaspar and Vasquez to understand without
interpretation.</p>

<p>The Indians said they wanted to trade.</p>

<p>We replied that we saw nothing they might trade with us.</p>

<p>In return they produced some roots and several small bags of pine nuts.</p>

<p>We then explained that we were reduced in ammunition, and had little
food.</p>

<p>Don Gaspar here interpolated hastily, saying that in his judgment it would be
absolutely necessary that we made some sort of a present to avoid the appearance
of intending an affront. Buck Barry and Jones seemed instantly to accept this
necessity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give them two or three of the saddle blankets,&#8221; suggested Barry,
after a moment&#8217;s thought. &#8220;We will have several light hosses going
out; and if we have to pad the saddles we can git along with skins or
something.&#8221;</p>

<p>We gave our visitors the blankets, therefore. They seemed well pleased,
arose, and shortly made a primitive sort of a camp a short distance outside our
stockade. We did no more washing that day. About five o&#8217;clock our hunters
came in with the best meat of a blacktail deer. Bagsby listened attentively to
our account of the interview. Then he took a hindquarter of the newly killed
buck and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span> departed
for the Indians&#8217; camp, where he stayed for an hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they are out for meanness,&#8221; he announced
when he returned. &#8220;They tell me this yere is on a sort of short cut from
some of the Truckee lakes down to their villages. But we got to keep a sharp eye
on our horses; and we got to stand guard to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very early in the morning, when we were just up, several of the elders came
over to tell us that some of the young men would stay to work for us, if we so
desired. We replied that we had no goods with which to pay for work. Shortly
after, the whole tribe vanished down river.</p>

<p>For two nights Bagsby insisted on standing guard, and on having some of us
take turns at it. Then we declined flatly to do so any longer. The Indians had
gone far downstream, as their trail indicated to our hunters, and had shown no
signs of even hesitating on the way. We fell into our old routine, and laughed
at Bagsby when he shook his head.</p>

<p>About this time Johnny and McNally, scrambling of a Sunday for the sake of a
view, stumbled on a small ravine that came nearer realizing our hoped-for strike
than anything we had yet seen. After &#8220;puddling out&#8221; a few potfuls of
the pay dirt, we decided to move the cradles. It was not over a half mile from
camp, but was out of sight of the stockade. The move was the occasion for a hot
discussion. Bagsby wanted to reorganize, and we were reluctant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar ought to be two men in camp,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span> thar ought never to be
less&#8217;n three together out hunting. And that&#8217;s my idee&#8211;that
ye&#8217;re paying me money for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That leaves us only four men to work the cradles,&#8221; I objected.
&#8220;Four men out of nine working.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thar won&#8217;t be <i>no</i> men out of nine a-workin&#8217; if
you don&#8217;t watch out,&#8221; predicted Bagsby. &#8220;You-all forgit this
is a self-supportin&#8217; community. We got to work for our living, as well as
for gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hunters might go out less,&#8221; suggested McNally.</p>

<p>&#8220;The miners might eat less, then,&#8221; replied Bagsby grimly.
&#8220;This ain&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call the best sort of a game
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>We came to it, of course, though with much grumbling. It seemed an almost
excuseless waste of good energy; a heavy price in economic efficiency to pay for
insurance against what seemed a very remote peril. But we did not know, and our
uncertainty gave way.</p>

<p>&#8220;But hang it!&#8221; cried Johnny, &#8220;here&#8217;s more gold than a
hundred men could begin to handle, and we&#8217;re wasting more than half our
resources.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It do seem so,&#8221; agreed Yank with his accustomed slow philosophy.
&#8220;But we can put in longer hours because we rest oftener.&#8221;</p>

<p>A week passed, and we had almost forgotten our chance visitors. One day the
two Spaniards, Buck Barry and I were at the cradle; Bagsby, Yank, and McNally
were the hunters for the day. Johnny and Missouri Jones kept camp.</p>

<p>We had had a most successful morning, and were just stacking our tools
preparatory to returning to camp for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_226'></a>226</span> dinner. Buck Barry was standing near some small
sage bushes at the upper end of the diggings. He was just in the act of lighting
a freshly filled pipe, when he stopped as though petrified, the burning match
suspended above the bowl of his pipe. Then he turned quickly toward the sage
brush; and as he did so a bow twanged and an arrow sang past his head so close
as actually to draw blood from the lobe of his ear. With a roar of anger Buck
Barry raised his pickaxe and charged into the bush. We saw a figure rise from
the ground, dash away, stumble flat. Before the man could get up again Buck
Barry was upon him, and the pickaxe descended. At the same instant we heard a
series of whoops and two shots in rapid succession from the direction of camp.
Buck Barry came bounding out of the sage brush, and seized his rifle from under
the bush where we had kept them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get out of
this!&#8221;</p>

<p>We ran as hard as we could go for a hundred yards, or until we had reached
the flat of the river bottom. Then we paused, uncertain as to just what next to
do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just take a
look,&#8221; and hurried up a little spur-knoll to the right. From that
elevation I instantly caught sight of a crowd of Indians coming up the valley at
full speed. Most of them were on horseback, but a number loped along on foot,
keeping up with the animals. One look was enough. I raced down to my companions
again; and we hastily took refuge in the only cover near enough to conceal
us&#8211;a little clump of willows in a small, damp watercourse. There we
crouched, rifles ready.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>I was terribly
excited. The patter of the horses was now plainly audible, though, owing to the
inequalities of the ground, they could not become visible farther than a hundred
yards away. I trembled violently, and cursed myself for a coward, though I
really do not think I was frightened. At any rate, I became deadly cool the
moment the first savage appeared; and I drew a steady bead and toppled him off
his horse before any one else had got in action. The shot brought them to a
stand. They had, I think, expected to find us in our ravine, and were surprised.
Immediately I dropped the butt of my rifle to the ground and began reloading. A
shower of arrows flew toward us, but were deflected by the criss-cross of the
willows. In fact, this lacework of stout branches seemed to be an excellent sort
of armour against arrows. In the meantime my companions had each dropped his
man; though Vasquez had better luck than skill, as his savage was only clipped
in the leg. I fired once more, and elicited a howl. There could be no missing at
the distance, unless a man quite lost his head; and personally I was too scared
for that. Another shower of arrows rattled in the willows; then the band broke
to right and left and raced away up the hills like mad. They had no courage, and
lost stomach for the fight at once when they found us prepared.</p>

<p>We were astonished and delighted, for we had fully expected to be ridden
down. As soon as we were quite certain this sudden retreat was not a ruse, we
came out from our shelter. How many wounded had made off&#8211;if any&#8211;we
could not tell. Three dead bodies lay on the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_228'></a>228</span> ground. To them we paid no attention, but, with
many forebodings, hurried back to camp.</p>

<p>When we appeared in sight Missouri Jones ran out to meet us, his rifle over
his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Johnny?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was down at the river a-getting water,&#8221; said Jones,
&#8220;and I ain&#8217;t seen him since.&#8221;</p>

<p>We all ran down to the edge of the river pool whence we drew our supply. For
a moment our hearts stood still, for no Johnny was in sight. Then he arose
dripping from the middle of the pool.</p>

<p>&#8220;This water&#8217;s cold,&#8221; he remarked conversationally. &#8220;I
think I&#8217;ll come out. Anybody hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>He waded ashore, and shook himself like a dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear &#8217;em until they were right on top of me; and
I couldn&#8217;t get away without being seen,&#8221; said he; &#8220;so I just
waded out and imitated a rock with my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>We roared with laughter by way of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the first time, Johnny,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; put in Missouri Jones. &#8220;This is
no joke. They got three of our hosses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told us his experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just a-browning of the venison,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;when
I happened to look up, and thar was three of our hosses running off, tails up,
and a half dozen Injuns a hoss-back driving &#8217;em. I let drive with old
Betsey and Johnny&#8217;s gun, but they was about out of range. While I was
looking after them about forty Injuns went past sky-hootin&#8217;. I suppose
they thought the first lot had all the hosses, and so they didn&#8217;t stop.
The rest of the hosses, luckily, was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_229'></a>229</span> asleep behind the cottonwoods. You bet I
didn&#8217;t call their attention to myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He exhibited the greatest satisfaction when he learned that we had accounted
for four.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s something like Injun fighting,&#8221; he observed,
&#8220;though these are a pore, spiritless lot. The whole bag ain&#8217;t worth
more than one of them good hosses.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did no more gold washing that day, but remained close in camp, consumed
with anxiety for our companions. From time to time we fired a rifle, with the
idea of warning them that something was amiss. The remaining half-dozen horses
we ran into the corral.</p>

<p>Night fell and still the hunters did not return. We were greatly alarmed and
distressed, but we could not think of anything to do, for we had not the least
idea in what direction to look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bagsby and Yank are old hands,&#8221; speculated Missouri Jones
consolingly. &#8220;And the fact that Injuns is abroad would make them slow and
careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>None of us felt like turning in. We all sat outside on the ground around a
little fire.</p>

<p>Toward midnight we heard voices; and a moment later Yank and Bagsby strode in
out of the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s McNally?&#8221; Yank instantly demanded.
&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he come in yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>We told him we had seen nothing of the missing man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;ll drift in pretty soon,&#8221; said Bagsby. &#8220;We
lost him in the darkness not two hours back.&#8221;</p>

<p>They set to frying some venison steak. Excitedly and in antiphony Johnny and
I detailed the day&#8217;s adventure. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_230'></a>230</span> Both the backwoodsmen listened in silence, but
without suspending their cooking.</p>

<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t bother McNally,&#8221; Bagsby decided.
&#8220;They&#8217;d drive those hosses away five or six miles before
they&#8217;d stop; and McNally was with us just a little piece back. He&#8217;ll
be in by the time the venison is cooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was not; nor by an hour later. Then we decided that we must go out to
look for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t see nothin&#8217; till daylight,&#8221; said Bagsby,
&#8220;but we can get started back for the last place we saw him.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now about one o&#8217;clock in the morning. Bagsby appointed Vasquez,
Missouri Jones, Buck Barry, Yank and myself to accompany him. Don Gaspar was
suffering from a slight attack of malarial fever; and Johnny, to his vast
disgust, was left to hold him company. We took each a horse, which we had to
ride bareback and with a twisted rope &#8220;war halter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bagsby led the way, and we followed closely nose to tail. It was an
interesting and wonderful experience, had I had more attention to give it, for
we rode mysteriously neck deep in velvet darkness over strange hills, and awful
shapes rose mysteriously, and the sky silvered with stars like the glittering of
little waves. But my mind was filled with dread and foreboding, and a great
anxiety for our merry, blue-eyed companion, and a very considerable wonder as to
how our guide managed to find his way.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate, however, as to direction; only occasionally he had to
stop and cast back and around for a way through. Often, at a low command from
him, we dismounted and led our animals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>We proceeded
thus for a long time&#8211;five or six miles, I should think. By the undefined
feeling of dark space at either hand I judged we must be atop a ridge. Bagsby
halted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was somewhere on this ridge we left him,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
reckon now we&#8217;d just better set down and wait for dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly we dismounted and drew together in a little group. Over the top
of the great ranges a gibbous moon rose slowly. By her dim light I could make
out the plunge on either side our ridge, and the other dark ridges across the
way. Behind us our horses occasionally stamped a hoof or blew softly through
their noses.</p>

<p>I lay flat on my back, and idly counted the stars. Happening to glance
sidewise, I caught the flicker of a distant light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bagsby,&#8221; I whispered, &#8220;there&#8217;s a fire not more than
a half mile away.&#8221;</p>

<p>He too lay down in order to get my angle of view.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not McNally,&#8221; he pronounced after a moment&#8217;s
careful inspection, &#8220;for it&#8217;s too big a fire, and it&#8217;s a lot
more than half a mile away. That&#8217;s a good big fire. I think it&#8217;s
Injuns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably the same gang that lifted our hosses!&#8221; cried Buck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; agreed Bagsby. He sat upright and peered at us
through the dim moonlight. &#8220;Want to get after them?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; said Buck emphatically, &#8220;They may have McNally,
and if they haven&#8217;t, they&#8217;ve got our horses.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_232'></a>232</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s six of us and we can shore make
it interesting for that lot,&#8221; agreed Yank. &#8220;Can we get to where they
are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so,&#8221; said Bagsby.</p>

<p>We rode for another hour, slanting down the mountainside toward the
flickering fire. Every time a horse rolled a rock or broke a dried branch it
seemed to me that the mountains reverberated from end to end. I don&#8217;t
believe I allowed myself to weigh over six ounces all told. Finally we left the
slope for the bottom of the valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather be below their camp than above it. It&#8217;s going
to be hard to get out this way,&#8221; complained Bagsby, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
the best we can do.&#8221; He dismounted us, and we crept forward another half
mile, leading our animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is as close as I dare take the hosses,&#8221; whispered Bagsby.
&#8220;Vasquez, you stay here with them,&#8221; he said in Spanish, &#8220;and
when I yell twice quick and sharp, you answer so we&#8217;ll know where to find
you. Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>We stole forward slowly. The fire leaped and flared beneath the widespread
branches of a tree. Around it lay a half dozen or so recumbent shapes wrapped in
blankets. How many more might be lying beyond the light circle we could not
tell. Beyond them we saw dimly the forms of dozing horses. Obeying a signal from
the old trapper, we circled the camp until we were on the same side as the
animals. They raised their heads and blew softly at us; but we lay still, and
shortly they quieted down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; breathed Bagsby, &#8220;when I give the word, fire. And
each man grab a horse by the picket rope, stampede the rest, and hustle back to
Vasquez. Ready!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>We raised our
pieces, but before the command to fire was given, one of the sleepers threw
aside his blanket, stretched himself and arose. It was a white man!</p>

<p>I confess that for a moment I turned physically sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; called Bagsby, quite unmoved.</p>

<p>The white man seized his rifle, and the recumbent forms leaped to life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he demanded sharply. &#8220;Speak
quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep yore ha&#8217;r on!&#8221; drawled the trapper, advancing into the
light. &#8220;We&#8217;re perfectly respectable miners, out looking for a lost
man; and we saw yore fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rest of us uttered a yell of joy and relief. One of the men who had been
sleeping around the fire was McNally himself.</p>

<p>We drew together, explaining, congratulating. The strangers, six in number,
turned out to be travellers from the eastern side of the ranges. They listened
with interest and attention to our account of the Indian attack. McNally
explained that he had been uncertain of his route in the dark; so that when he
had caught sight of the fire he had made his way to it. We were still engaged in
this mutual explanation when we were struck dumb by a long-drawn-out yell from
the direction of our own horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Vasquez,&#8221; explained Barry. &#8220;He wants to let us know
where he is,&#8221; and he answered the yell.</p>

<p>But at that moment one of our own horses dashed up to the bunch of picketed
animals and wheeled, trembling. Its rope bridle dangled broken from its head.
Sam Bagsby darted forward to seize the hanging cord.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_234'></a>234</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s cut!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Quick! Out across the valley, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>We followed him into the moonlight, grasping our rifles. A moment later a
compact band swept toward us at full speed, our horses in the lead, their rope
halters dangling, a dozen Indians on horseback following close at their heels
and urging them on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot, boys!&#8221; yelled Bagsby, discharging his own piece.</p>

<p>Our rifles cracked. It was impossible to take aim; and I am sure we hit
nothing. But the horses swerved aside from the long fiery flashes, and so ran
into the picketed lot and stopped. The Indians flew on through our scattered
line without stopping, pursued by a sputter of shots from our Colt&#8217;s
revolvers.</p>

<p>&#8220;A while ago I was sorry we had to stop above camp,&#8221; said Bagsby
with satisfaction; &#8220;but it was a lucky thing for us. They had to come by
us to git out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Vasquez?&#8221; Yank struck across our exultation.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span><a id='link_25'></a>CHAPTER XXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>BATTLE</span></h2>

<p>We had a good deal of trouble finding the exact spot where we had left him,
for we could get no answer to our calls. He was down in a heap, covered with
blood, and quite dead. The savages had scalped him. In our long companionship we
had grown very fond of him, for he was a merry, good-natured, willing soul.</p>

<p>&#8220;God!&#8221; cried Bagsby, deeply moved. &#8220;I&#8217;ll put a ball
through the next one of those devils I meet!&#8221;</p>

<p>We returned slowly to the fire, carrying the body, which we laid reverently
one side and covered with a blanket. In all our hearts burned a fierce, bitter
anger. Sullenly we turned to prepare ourselves a meal from the supplies our
hosts offered us.</p>

<p>The latter were the father and five sons of a backwoods family from the
northwest&#8211;Pine, by name. They were all tall, heavily built men, slow
moving, slow speaking, with clear, steady eyes, a drawling way of talking, and
the appearance always of keeping a mental reservation as to those with whom they
conversed. I suppose they were ignorant enough men, as far as education goes,
but they always impressed me as being somehow a superior type. Possibly it was
because of the fact that they perfectly corresponded to their environment, which
was the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>In detail, the
old man was upward of sixty, his beard long and grizzled, his hair about his
shoulders. The oldest son would count about thirty, and the others went down in
stepladder fashion to the youngster, a fine, big, smooth-faced boy of sixteen.
They were named after old Pine&#8217;s favourite heroes, evidently. There was
David Crockett Pine, and Governor Boggs Pine, and President Tyler Pine, and
Daniel Boone Pine, and Old Hickory Pine, the youngest, an apparent contradiction
in terms. They were called by their odd first names&#8211;Governor, President,
Old&#8211;without the least humour.</p>

<p>Just now they stood tall and grim behind us as we ate; and the gray dawn and
the rose dawn grew into day. Nobody said anything until we had finished. Then
Yank rose to his full height and faced the attentive men.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want vengeance,&#8221; he announced in an even voice, stretching
forth his long, lean arm. &#8220;Those devils have harried our stock and killed
our pardner; and I&#8217;m not going to set quiet and let them do it.&#8221; He
turned to us: &#8220;Boys,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I know you&#8217;re with me
thar. But I&#8217;m going to git our friends yere to go with us. Old man,&#8221;
he said to Pine, &#8220;you and yore sons help us with this job, and we&#8217;ll
locate you on the purtiest diggings in these hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; agreed McNally.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to make my boys no offer,&#8221; replied Pine
slowly. &#8220;Those divils were after our hosses too; and they&#8217;d have got
them if you hadn&#8217;t come along. We&#8217;d been told by a man we believe
that there wan&#8217;t no Injuns in this country, or you wouldn&#8217;t have
seen us sleeping es <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_237'></a>237</span> close to our fire. Whar do you-all reckon to come
up with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Our old trapper interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their rancheree is down the valley somewhars,&#8221; said Bagsby,
&#8220;and we&#8217;ll have to scout for it. We must go back to camp first and
get a ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>McNally and I murmured against this check to immediate action, but saw the
point after a moment. The Pines packed their slender outfit; we bound the body
of our poor friend across his horse, and mournfully retraced our steps.</p>

<p>We arrived in camp about ten o&#8217;clock, to find Johnny and Don Gaspar
anxiously on the alert. When we had imparted our news, their faces, too,
darkened with anger. Of us all Vasquez had been the only man who never lost his
temper, who had always a flash of a smile for the hardest days. Hastily we threw
together provisions for several days, and arranged our affairs as well as we
could. We all wanted to go; and Don Gaspar, in spite of the remains of his
malarial fever, fairly insisted on accompanying the expedition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Señores,&#8221; he said with dignity, &#8220;this was my own man from
my own people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless somebody had to stay in camp, although at first some of us were
inclined to slur over that necessity.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a strong chance that Injuns will drift by and take all
our supplies,&#8221; Bagsby pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chances are slim&#8211;in only a day or so; you must admit
that,&#8221; argued Johnny. &#8220;Let&#8217;s risk it. We can scratch along if
they do take our stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the gold?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>That nonplussed
us for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not bury it?&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>Bagsby and Pine snorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any Injun would find it in a minute,&#8221; said Pine.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they know gold&#8217;s worth something, too,&#8221; put in
Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a scout, not a house-moving expedition,&#8221; said Bagsby
decidedly, &#8220;and somebody&#8217;s got to keep camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay, fer one,&#8221; offered old man Pine, his eyes
twinkling from beneath his fierce brows. &#8220;I&#8217;ve fit enough Injuns in
my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some further wrangling we came to drawing lots. A number of small white
pebbles and one darker were shaken up in a hat. I drew in the fourth turn, and
got the black!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard luck, son!&#8221; murmured old man Pine.</p>

<p>The rest were eager to be off. They leaped upon their horses, brandishing
their long rifles, and rode off down the meadow. Old man Pine leaned on the
muzzle of his gun, his eyes gleaming, uttering commands and admonitions to his
five sons.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Old,&#8221; he warned his youngest, &#8220;you mind and behave;
and don&#8217;t come back yere without&#8217;n you bring a skelp!&#8221;</p>

<p>We spent the next two days strictly in defence, for we dared not stay long
from the stockade. I was so thoroughly downcast at missing the fight that I paid
little attention to Pine&#8217;s well-meant talk. My depression was enhanced by
the performance of the duty the others had left to our leisure. I mean the
interment of poor Vasquez. We <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_239'></a>239</span> buried him in a grassy little flat; and I occupied
my time hewing and fashioning into the shape of a cross two pine logs, on the
smoothed surface of which I carved our friend&#8217;s name. Then I returned to
the stockade, where old man Pine, a picturesque, tall figure in his fringed
hunter&#8217;s buckskin, sat motionless before the cabin door. From that point
of vantage one could see a mile down the valley, and some distance upstream; and
one or the other of us occupied it constantly.</p>

<p>About three o&#8217;clock of the second day Pine remarked quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thar they come!&#8221;</p>

<p>I was instantly by his side, and we strained our eyesight in an attempt to
count the shifting figures. Pine&#8217;s vision was better and more practised
than mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all thar,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and they&#8217;re driving
extry hosses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the cavalcade stopped and the men dismounted wearily. They
were, as the old man had said, driving before them a half dozen ponies, which
Governor Boggs herded into the corral. Nobody said a word. One or two stretched
themselves. Johnny seized the cup and took a long drink. Yank leaned his rifle
against the wall. Old man Pine&#8217;s keen, fierce eye had been roving over
every detail, though he, too, had kept silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Old,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;I see you obeyed orders like a
good sojer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dad,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And then I saw what I had not noticed before: that at <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span> the belt of each of the tall, silent
young backwoodsmen hung one or more wet, heavy, red and black soggy strips. The
scalping had been no mere figure of speech! Thank heaven! none of our own people
were similarly decorated!</p>

<p>So horrified and revolted was I at this discovery that I hardly roused myself
to greet the men. I looked with aversion, and yet with a certain fascination on
the serene, clear features of these scalp takers. Yet, since, in the days
following, this aversion could not but wear away in face of the simplicity and
straightforwardness of the frontiersmen, I had to acknowledge that the atrocious
deed was more a product of custom than of natural barbarity.</p>

<p>Old Pine, of course not at all affected, bustled about in the more practical
matter of getting coffee and cutting meat; and after a moment I aroused myself
to help him. The men lay about on the ground exhausted. They drank the coffee
and ate the meat, and so revived, little by little, arrived at the point of
narration.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure one hell of a ride down there,&#8221; remarked McNally
with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good deal like the foothills of th&#8217; Snake Range, pop,&#8221; put
in President Tyler Pine.</p>

<p>&#8220;We been riding purty nigh every minute sence we left here,&#8221;
agreed Bagsby. &#8220;That rancheree was hard to find.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little by little the tale developed. No one man, in the presence of all the
others, felt like telling us the whole story. We gathered that they had ridden
the cañon for several hours, past our first camping grounds, and finally <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span> out into the lower
ranges. Here they lost the trail left by the Indians when they had first visited
our camp; but in casting in circles for it had come on fresher pony tracks.
These they had followed persistently for many miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> couldn&#8217;t see the sign of a track for a mile at a time,
on that hard ground,&#8221; interpolated Johnny.</p>

<p>At length the tracks had struck into a beaten trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then we knew we were on the way to the rancheree,&#8221; said
Bagsby.</p>

<p>The village they found located in a flat by the side of a stream, and they
halted to determine just what to do. It was finally decided that while an attack
on horseback would undoubtedly strike more instant terror, yet the difficulty of
shooting accurately from a gallop would more than offset this effect. Therefore
nine of the party crept up afoot, leaving three to lead forward the horses some
distance in the rear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was one of them,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;They evidently have seen
me shoot. I seem to be always out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men had wormed their way to within a hundred yards of the flimsy huts, or
tepees, when they were discovered by the dogs. The Indians immediately rushed
out pell-mell, in a crowd, and were met by a deadly volley from the white
men&#8217;s rifles. Caught absolutely by surprise, they turned and fled. Some
few loosed random arrows. Their horses coming up at a run in convoy of the rear
guard, each man threw himself into his saddle and started in pursuit, shooting
right and left with the Colt&#8217;s revolvers whenever they caught up with the
fugitives. Johnny told <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_242'></a>242</span> admiringly how the backwoodsmen had reloaded their
rifles while galloping.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I could do to shoot mine off, let alone loading!&#8221; he
confessed.</p>

<p>There was no resistance, and little mortality after the first volley. The
Indians bolted like rabbits into the brush. The white men then returned
leisurely to the village, which they proceeded to burn to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;It made a grand bonfire,&#8221; interrupted Johnny. &#8220;Went up
like gunpowder. And the Indians yelled and howled at us from the sidehills all
the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The raiders had fired a few defiant and random shots in the direction of the
howling, and then, after collecting the ponies that had not stampeded, rode
slowly back the way they had come.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t see anything of our three horses?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary hoss,&#8221; said Buck Barry. &#8220;I figger they jest nat&#8217;rally
stampeded off when the row started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure those were the same Indians?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>A long silence fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what if they wasn&#8217;t&#8211;and that&#8217;s by no means
sure,&#8221; demanded Buck Barry at last, a little defiantly. &#8220;The whole
lot is thieves and murderers; and if they&#8217;d had a chance at us, you bet
they&#8217;d have taken it. And we showed the red devils they can&#8217;t monkey
with us!&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked toward the cross over Vasquez, murdered as wantonly as ever man was
murdered for plunder, and could find nothing to say. Whatever the eternal
equities of the case may be&#8211;and long since I have given up trying to guess
what they are&#8211;the cold, practical fact remains, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span> that never during our stay on the
Porcupine did any Indian come near us again. And I am convinced that if the
initial stealing of horses and murder had gone without reprisal, we should have
been a second time and more boldly attacked. But if that was the wrong village,
what a train of reprisals and reprisals again in turn we may have laid!</p>

<p>&#8220;Only we didn&#8217;t start it, and never would have!&#8221; persisted
Johnny stoutly.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span><a id='link_26'></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>WE SEND OUT OUR TREASURE</span></h2>

<p>Though these Indian troubles had nothing to do with it, nevertheless they
marked the beginning of our change of luck. We suffered no definite misfortunes;
but things did not go well. The slight malarial attack of Don Gaspar was the
first of an annoying series. I suppose we had all been inoculated on the marshes
of the Sacramento, and the disease had remained latent in our systems. The hard
work in the open air had kept us healthy; but the fever only awaited the
favourable moment of depression or of overwork. The combination of ice cold
water around our legs and burning sun on our heads was not the best in the
world. Fortunately Yank, who came from an ague country, had had foresight enough
to bring a supply of quinine. For two months one or the other of us was ailing;
and once for a few days five of us were down!</p>

<p>Then, too, I think the zest of the game was palling on us a little, strange
as it may seem. We could dig gold from the soil almost at will. It would seem
that this single fact would keep normally acquisitive men keyed to a high pitch
of endeavour all the time; but it was not so. I suppose we needed a vacation. We
began to discuss what we would do when we should see the city again. No one for
a moment dreamed that we should quit these rich <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_245'></a>245</span> diggings. We were here to make our fortunes; and
the fortunes seemed to be ready for the making. Only the novelty having passed,
it had become hard work, just like the making of any other kind of a
fortune.</p>

<p>The Pine family camped below us, used our corral, at our invitation, and set
placidly to work. They were typical frontiersmen, and settled down in the
well-built cabin which they quickly ran up as though they meant to make of it a
permanent home. For two months, which brought us up to the end of July, they
lived a regular and leisurely life. Then one morning, without any warning at
all, they rode over to our cabin, leading their horses, fully packed. Old man
Pine explained, while his five tall, steady-eyed sons sat their horses quite
immobile in the background, that they had dug enough gold for their necessities,
and that they were now going down to the lower country to pick out some good
land. These men were the very first I happened to meet who had come into the
country with a definite idea of settling.</p>

<p>After the departure of this strong force, began our discussions as to the
safeguarding of our gold. It had now reached a very considerable
sum&#8211;somewhere near thirty-five thousand dollars, as I remember it. Bagsby
was very uneasy at its presence in camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Injuns are beginning to know it&#8217;s wuth something,&#8221; he
pointed out. &#8220;They don&#8217;t know yet how much, but they know it will
buy beads and buttons and paint and whiskey and everything else an Injun wants.
And they know that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re yere for; and that we must have a
lot of it. I don&#8217;t calc&#8217;late that lot we licked will bother <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span> us ag&#8217;in; but
they&#8217;ll spread the news we&#8217;re yere. And there&#8217;s lots of
bandits and scoundrels glad to take a chance at us. And while we come out all
right before, they&#8217;ll git us in the long run if we keep at it. I&#8217;d
like to git rid of the stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Gaspar agreed with him, as did also Yank, Buck Barry, and Missouri Jones.
McNally, Johnny, and I inclined to the belief that we would do better to keep
our wealth by us until we finally left the diggings, maintaining always a proper
guard. We could not quite see how the sending out of the gold would much reduce
the likelihood of attack; but the others seemed to think the gold would then be
safe anyhow, and that the news of its delivery at Sutter&#8217;s Fort would soon
spread abroad.</p>

<p>About this time the discussion took a more practical turn from the fact that
our provisions had run so low that we had put ourselves on half rations. As we
did not believe it desirable nor healthy to drop down to an exclusively game
diet, it would soon become necessary to go for more flour and coffee.</p>

<p>Buck Barry now brought up again strongly the advisability of sending our
treasure out to a safe place. His argument was given point by the arrival in
camp one evening of three evil-looking Mexicans, shabbily clothed, but
well-armed, and mounted on beautiful horses. We fed them well, but saw to the
caps of our revolvers and the security of our corral before turning in for the
night. In the morning they departed before we were stirring, without so much as
a word of thanks. These mysterious visitors had given us no faintest inkling of
their business or destination. Don <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_247'></a>247</span> Gaspar stated flatly that they had come to spy us
out, having heard of our presence in the valley from the Indians.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I told them,&#8221; said he triumphantly, &#8220;that essoon we
would be sen&#8217; out for the food.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on to argue that thus he had prepared their minds for the fact that
pack-horses would soon be going out. By distributing the gold its presence would
be unsuspected.</p>

<p>I suggested a strong guard, but both Bagsby and Don Gaspar opposed me.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s enough of these yere robbers to git us anyhow, even if
we all went,&#8221; said Bagsby, &#8220;and that&#8217;s why I want to send the
stuff out now. The place they&#8217;ll tackle will be right yere, if they tackle
anything at all&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>I will not weary you with the pros and cons. At the time I thought, and I
still think, the whole arrangement most ill advised; but against me was the
united opinion of nearly the whole camp, including the most level-headed members
of my own party. It was finally agreed that Yank, Buck Barry, and Don Gaspar
should take out the gold.</p>

<p>They started very early in the morning, carrying the treasure in saddle-bags
and across the horns of the saddle. I argued that Yank rode much the lightest
and had the strongest horse, and managed to get the others to confide to him a
full half of the metal. At the last moment we had modified the original plan to
suit everybody. The horsemen encumbered by pack-animals were to push on as
rapidly as possible in order to reach by nightfall the settlement where dwelt
the Italian friend. Once there they <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_248'></a>248</span> could feel themselves reasonably safe. Johnny,
Missouri Jones and I would ride with them until noon as a sort of escort for the
uninhabited portion of the journey. By that hour we figured we should have
reached the outskirts of the regular diggings, where, our experience told us,
our companions would be safe.</p>

<p>Accordingly we pushed our mounts hard. Unhampered by pack-animals, and aided
by knowledge of the route, we made great progress. By noon we had passed the
meadow of our night&#8217;s camp. After a hasty lunch we accompanied our men a
few miles farther, then said farewell and godspeed, and hurried back in order to
reach home before sunset.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span><a id='link_27'></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE ROBBERY</span></h2>

<p>We cooked ourselves a meal, and built ourselves a fire. About midnight we
heard the sounds of horses rapidly approaching. Immediately we leaped from our
bunks and seized our rifles, peering anxiously into the darkness. A moment
later, however, we were reassured by a shrill whistle peculiar to Buck Barry,
and a moment later he and Don Gaspar rode into camp.</p>

<p>We assailed them with a storm of questions&#8211;why had they returned? what
had happened? where was Yank? had there been an accident?</p>

<p>Don Gaspar, who appeared very weary and depressed, shook his head sadly.
Barry looked at us savagely from beneath his brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gold is gone; and that&#8217;s an end of it!&#8221; he
growled.</p>

<p>At these words a careful, dead silence fell on us all. The situation had
suddenly become too serious for hasty treatment. We felt instinctively that a
wrong word might do irreparable damage. But in our hearts suspicion and anger
and dull hatred leaped to life full grown. We tightened our belts, as it were,
and clamped our elbows to our sides, and became wary, watching with unfriendly
eyes. Johnny alone opened his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost? I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>Barry cast an
ugly look at him, but said nothing. We all saw that look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Yank?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead by now, I suppose,&#8221; flung back Barry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; I cried; and under my breath, &#8220;Then
you&#8217;ve murdered him!&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know whether Barry heard me or not, and at the time I did not
much care. His sullen eye was resting on one after the other of us as we stood
there in the firelight. Every face was angry and suspicious. Barry flung himself
from his horse, tore the pad from its back, slapped it on the flank, and turned
away, reckless of where it went. He cut himself a steak and set to cooking his
food, an uncompromising shoulder turned in our direction; nor did he open his
mouth to utter another word until the general discussion later in the evening.
Don Gaspar, who owned the only riding saddle, unharnessed his horse, led it to
water, knee haltered it, and turned it loose to graze. While he was gone no one
spoke, but we glanced at each other darkly. He returned, sat down by the fire,
rolled himself a cigaretto, and volunteered his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;My fren&#8217;,&#8221; said he, with a directness and succinctness
utterly foreign to his everyday speech, &#8220;you want to know what
happen&#8217;. Ver&#8217; well; it was like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told us that, after we had left them, they hurried on as fast as possible
in order to reach the settled country. Owing to the excellence of his animal he
was generally some distance in advance. At one point, stopping on a slight
elevation to allow them to catch up, he looked back in time to see two men on
horseback emerge from the chaparral <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_251'></a>251</span> just behind his companions. Don Gaspar shouted and
leaped from his saddle; but before the warning had reached the others, a riata
from the hand of one of the men had fallen with deadly accuracy around
Yank&#8217;s arms and body, jerking him violently from the saddle. The thrower
whirled his horse to drag his victim, Don Gaspar fired, and by great good luck
shot the animal through the brain. It fell in a heap, pinning its rider beneath
it. In the meantime Barry had leaped to the ground, and from behind the shelter
of his horse had shot the first robber through the body. Our two companions now
drew together, and took refuge behind some large rocks, preparing to receive the
charge of a band of half dozen who now appeared. The situation looked desperate.
Don Gaspar fired and missed. He was never anything of a marksman, and his first
shot must have been a great piece of luck. Barry held his fire. The robbers each
discharged his rifle, but harmlessly. Then just as they seemed about to charge
in, they whirled their horses and made off into the brush.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could not tell the why,&#8221; observed Don Gaspar.</p>

<p>The two men did not speculate, but ran out to where Yank lay, apparently
dead, his arms still bound close to his body by the noose of the riata. Barry
cut the rope with his bowie knife, and they rolled him over. They found he still
breathed, but that, beside the shock of his violent fall, he had been badly
trampled by the horses. After a moment he came to consciousness, but when they
attempted to lift him upright, they found that his leg was broken.</p>

<p>At this moment they heard the sound of voices, and, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span> looking up, saw coming from the other
direction a band of a dozen men, half of whom were on horseback, and all of whom
were armed. This looked serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got behind the rock,&#8221; said Don Gaspar, &#8220;but we think to
ourself our goose is cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>The newcomers, however, proved to be miners, who had heard the shots, and who
now came hurrying up. Evidently the robbers had caught sight or sound of their
approach. They were much interested in the state of affairs, examined the horse
Don Gaspar had killed, searched for and found the body of the robber Barry had
shot. It proved to be a Mexican, well known to them all, and suspected to be a
member of Andreas Amijo&#8217;s celebrated band. They inquired for the dead
horse&#8217;s rider.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then, for the first time,&#8221; said Don Gaspar, &#8220;we think
of him. He went down with his horse. But now he was gone; and also the horse of
Señor Yank. But I think he crawl off in the chaparral; and that the horse of
Señor Yank run away with the other horse of the dead man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then, I must confess, to our disbelief in the tale, Don Gaspar told us
that the miners, their curiosity satisfied, calmly prepared to return to their
diggings, quite deaf to all appeals for further help.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say to us,&#8221; narrated Don Gaspar evenly, &#8220;that they
wash much gold, and that they cannot take the time; and when I tell them our
friend is dying, they laugh, and essay that we ought to be glad they come and
essave <i>our</i> lives; and that we get along all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not believe this, though we could see no object in Don Gaspar&#8217;s
deceiving us on the point. Three months <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_253'></a>253</span> had passed while we had been isolated in the valley
of the Porcupine; and we had not yet been taught what a difference three months
can make in a young country. In that time thousands had landed, and the diggings
had filled. All the world had turned to California; its riffraff and
offscourings as well as its true men. Australia had unloaded its ex-convicts, so
that the term &#8220;Sydney duck&#8221; had become only too well known. The
idyllic time of order and honesty and pleasant living with one&#8217;s
fellow-men was over. But we were unaware of that; and, knowing the average
generous-hearted miner, we listened to Don Gaspar with a certain surprised
skepticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I follow them,&#8221; said Don Gaspar, &#8220;and I offer them to
pay; and after a while two of them come back with me, and we make a litter of
branches with many blanket; and we carry Señor Yank down to the town. There is a
town there now. And by good chance,&#8221; concluded Don Gaspar with a little
show of quiet racial pride, &#8220;we find a California man and his wife, and
they do their bes&#8217; for Señor Yank, who is very essick, and I think he is
now dead from the tramp of the horses. And we borrow the fresh horse and come
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was indeed, as I think of it, a wonderful ride in the darkness; but at the
time my mind was full of our poor friend. The others, however, thought only of
the gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have left,&#8221; replied Don Gaspar to the rudely expressed shower
of questions, &#8220;just the one half. It is well known to all that Señor Yank
carried the most of the gold.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>&#8220;Yes, and
we have Munroe to thank for that,&#8221; snarled Missouri Jones.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far at that is concerned, I was against sending out the gold from
the very start,&#8221; I retorted. &#8220;If you&#8217;d listened to me, it
would have all been safe right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;d had a decently strong guard, we&#8217;d have been all
right,&#8221; growled McNally.</p>

<p>We all saw the futility of our first instinctive flare of suspicion. It was
obvious that if Don Gaspar and Buck Barry had intended treachery they would
never have returned to us. I think that, curiously enough, we were unreasonably
a little sorry for this. It would have been satisfactory to have had something
definite to antagonize. As it was, we sat humped around our fire until morning.
For a long period we remained sullenly silent; then we would break into
recriminations or into expressions of bitter or sarcastic dissatisfaction with
the way things had been planned and carried out. Bagsby alone had the sense to
turn in. We chewed the cud of bitter disappointment. Our work had been hard and
continuous; we were, as I have pointed out, just ready for a reaction; and now
this catastrophe arrived in the exact moment to throw us into the depths of
genuine revulsion. We hated each other, and the work, and the valley of the
Porcupine, and gold diggings, and California with a fine impartiality. The gray
morning light found us sitting haggard, dejected, disgusted, and vindictive
around the dying embers of our fire.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span><a id='link_28'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BULLY</span></h2>

<p>With daylight we began to get a grip on ourselves a little. I felt strongly
that I should see to Yank, and so announced. Johnny at once offered to accompany
me. While we were talking over the future prospects, McNally came over to us,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;The boys are pretty well agreed that we ought to divide up what gold
is left, and let each man take care of his own share. Are you
agreeable?&#8221;</p>

<p>We instantly assented. The scales were brought out, and the division began.
It consumed most of the morning, and was productive of much squabbling, in
which, however, we took no part. Our share, including Yank&#8217;s&#8211;with
which we were intrusted&#8211;came to about thirty-one pounds: a value of about
seven thousand dollars. We were impatient to be off, and now wanted nothing so
much as to be done with the whole affair. Yank had ridden one of our horses; the
other had been stolen in the Indian raid. We approached Don Gaspar, who had his
own saddle horse and that of Vasquez, not to speak of the remaining
pack-animals. To our surprise and delight he offered to accompany us; and
Bagsby, too, decided to leave. McNally, Buck Barry, and Missouri Jones, however,
could not be persuaded out of their intention of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span> remaining to dig fresh gold; nor, I am
afraid, were we very cordial in our insistence. We considered them foolhardy;
but in our then mood we did not greatly care.</p>

<p>By noon we had packed our goods, and by night we had broken the back of our
return journey.</p>

<p>We found a full-grown town where we had left a few tents and miners&#8217;
cabins. Its main street ran either side the deep dust of the immigrant trail,
and consisted of the usual shanties, canvas shacks, and log structures, with
rather more than the customary allowance of tin cans, old clothes, worn-out
boots, and empty barrels kicking around. The diggings were in the gulch below
the road; but the streets of the town, and especially the shady sides of the
buildings, were numerously furnished with lounging men. Some of these were
employees or owners of the gambling halls, saloons, and boarding-houses; but
most were plain &#8220;loafers&#8221;&#8211;a class never wholly absent from any
mining camp, men who washed just enough gold to keep themselves fed and pickled
in drink. Many of them were evil-looking customers, in fact about as tough a lot
as a man would care to see, unshaven generally, but not always, dirty, truculent
and rough, insolent in manner. In our passage of the main street I saw just
three decent looking people&#8211;one was evidently a gambler, one a beefy,
red-faced individual who had something to do with one of the hotels, and the
third was a tall man, past middle age, with a clean shaven, hawk face, a
piercing, haughty, black eye, and iron gray hair. He was carefully and
flawlessly dressed in a gray furred &#8220;plug&#8221; hat, tailed blue coat
with brass buttons, a buff waistcoat, trousers of the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span> same shade, and a frilled shirt front.
Immaculate down to within six inches or so of the ground, his nether garments
and boots were coated thickly with the inevitable red dust. He strode slowly
down the street, looking neither to right nor left.</p>

<p>Don Gaspar led the way for a short distance along the wagon road. On the
outskirts of the settlement he turned aside to a small log cabin supplemented by
a brush lean-to. A long string of bright red peppers hung down the face of it.
To our knock came a very fat, rather dirty, but exceedingly pleasant-faced woman
with glossy black hair, parted smoothly, and soft black eyes. She opened the
door only the fraction of an inch at first, but instantly recognized Don Gaspar,
and threw it wide.</p>

<p>To our great relief we found Yank very much alive. He greeted us rather
feebly, but with satisfaction. We found that he had been kindly cared for, and
that the surface wounds and bruises from the horses&#8217; hoofs had been
treated with some skill.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I reckon I&#8217;m hurt some inside,&#8221; he whispered with
difficulty, &#8220;for I can&#8217;t breathe easy; and I can&#8217;t eat
nothin&#8217; but soup. And my leg is hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The broken leg too had been bound up after a fashion, but it was badly
swollen above and below the bandages.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to have a doctor,&#8221; said I positively.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt of that. There must be some among the
miners&#8211;there generally is. I&#8217;m going to see if I can find
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>I returned to town, and hunted up the beefy, red-faced hotel keeper, who had
impressed me as being an honest man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s a doctor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;a mighty good one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span> He went by here a
little while ago. Name&#8217;s Dr. Rankin. I&#8217;ll rustle him out for you.
Oh, you Pete!&#8221; he shouted into the interior of the building.</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s shuffling about preceded the appearance of a negro boy of
twelve or fourteen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sah.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go find Dr. Rankin and bring him here right away. Tell him a gentleman
wants him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a mighty sudden sort of camp here,&#8221; said I, as
we settled ourselves to wait. &#8220;Three months ago I went through here, and
there was practically nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks to be a thousand years, though,&#8221; agreed the hotel man.
&#8220;Where you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, just prospecting,&#8221; I replied vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just fair,&#8221; I evaded; &#8220;not rich enough to keep me from
coming back, you see. Any finds here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The diggings are rich as mud,&#8221; replied the hotel man
dispassionately. &#8220;It&#8217;s a prosperous camp all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t &#8217;wash&#8217; yourself?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I! I make more than my &#8216;ounce a day&#8217; right here.&#8221; He
jerked his thumb at his hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many &#8216;loafers,&#8217;&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily, hesitated for a moment, then evidently changed his
mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a few,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>At this moment the negro boy appeared, closely followed by the man with the
blue coat and white beaver hat whom I had taken for an eccentric gambler. This
man walked slowly up to face me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>&#8220;Well,
sir?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I am told I can be of service. In what
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>His piercing black eye held mine with a certain high arrogance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professionally, doctor,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;A friend of mine is
lying badly hurt in a nearby hut.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a barely appreciable instant his eye held mine after I had ceased
speaking, as though he was appraising me. Then he bowed with old-fashioned
courtesy.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service, sir,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Pete, you black rascal,
get my bag, and get it quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little negro, who had stood by obviously worshipping, broke into a grin
and darted into the hotel, almost instantly reappearing with a regulation
professional satchel.</p>

<p>&#8220;At your service, sir,&#8221; repeated Dr. Rankin.</p>

<p>We took our stately progress up the street, through the deep red dust. The
hot sun glared down upon us, reflecting from the surface of the earth in
suffocating heat. Hard as I was, I flushed and perspired. The doctor never
turned a hair. As we passed one of the saloons a huge, hairy man lurched out,
nearly colliding with us. He was not drunk, but he was well flushed with drink.
His mood was evidently ugly, for he dropped his hand to the butt of his
revolver, and growled something truculent at me, glaring through bloodshot eyes.
Dr. Rankin, who had stepped back to avoid collision, spoke up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Malone,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I told you a week ago that you have to
stop drinking or come to me. I repeat it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>He turned his
keen black eyes upon the big man, and stepped forward. The big man muttered
something and moved aside.</p>

<p>Arrived at the hut of the Moreñas, for that it seemed was the name of our
host and hostess, Dr. Rankin laid aside his furry beaver hat, walked directly to
the side of the bunk on which Yank lay, and began his examination, without
vouchsafing anything or anybody else the slightest glance. Nor did he seem to
pay more attention to Yank as a human being, but prodded and pulled and hauled
and manipulated him from top to toe, his gray, hawk face intent and absorbed.
Occasionally, as he repeated some prod, he looked up keenly into Yank&#8217;s
face, probably for some slight symptom of pain that escaped us, for Yank
remained stoical. But he asked no questions. At the end of ten minutes he threw
the blanket over our friend&#8217;s form and stood erect, carefully dusting the
ends of his fingers against one another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Broken leg, badly set,&#8221; said he; &#8220;two broken ribs; severe
surface bruises; and possibility of internal bruises in the region of the
spleen. Neglected too long. Why wasn&#8217;t I sent for before?&#8221;</p>

<p>I explained. Dr. Rankin listened attentively, but made no comment. His eyes
travelled slowly over us all&#8211;the fat, pleasant, brown California woman,
her bearded husband, who had come in from the diggings, Bagsby&#8217;s tall,
wiry old form, the worn remains of Don Gaspar&#8217;s finery, and lingered a
moment on Johnny&#8217;s undisguisable air of high spirit and breeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many of you belong here?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;I <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span> can&#8217;t waste time
on the rest of you. Those who are not directly concerned, kindly step
outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Johnny and I will take care of this,&#8221; I told the others hastily,
before they had time to say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; cried Dr. Rankin, removing his blue coat, and turning back
the frills of his shirt, &#8220;hot water!&#8221;</p>

<p>We assisted at the rather dreadful process of resetting a broken leg three
days old. At the end of the operation we were all pretty limp.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221; gasped Yank, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three months; not a day less if you want that leg to be as good as
ever,&#8221; stated Dr. Rankin uncompromisingly.</p>

<p>Yank closed his eyes and groaned.</p>

<p>The doctor resumed his coat and picked up his beaver hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What treatment?&#8221; I ventured to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will inform the woman,&#8221; replied the doctor. &#8220;These
Californians are the best nurses in the world, once things are on a proper
footing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your fee, sir?&#8221; asked Johnny very formally, for the
doctor&#8217;s brusque manner had rubbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;One ounce,&#8221; stated Dr. Rankin. &#8220;I shall direct the woman,
and I shall return one week from to-day unless conditions change. In that case,
summon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pouched the gold dust that Johnny shook into the palm of his hand at a
guess, bowed formally to each of us in turn, picked up his bag and departed,
rigidly erect, the fine red dust crawling and eddying at his feet.</p>

<p>Then we held a council of war, all of us. Don Gaspar <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span> announced his intention of returning to
his rancho in the south.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have found the gold, and I have made fren&#8217;s, and I have now
enough,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Bagsby, too, said he thought he would just ride down as far as Sutter&#8217;s
Fort, there to lay in a supply of powder and ball for a trip in the
mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kind of want to git up another b&#8217;ar fight,&#8221; said he. &#8220;If
I thought there was a ghost of a show to git them robbers for you boys,
I&#8217;d stay and help you scout for them; but there ain&#8217;t a show in the
world. They&#8217;ve had a good three days&#8217; start.&#8221;</p>

<p>After shaking hands with us again and again, and obtaining promises that we
should all surely meet in San Francisco or Monterey, they mounted and took their
departure in order to get well clear of the settlement before nightfall.</p>

<p>When they had gone Yank opened his eyes from the apparent sleep into which he
had fallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You fellows don&#8217;t hang around here with me, I can tell you
that,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;I&#8217;m fixed all right. I want you to make
arrangements with these people yere to keep me; tuck my gold under my piller,
stack old Betsey up yere in the corner by me, and go about your business. You
come out yere to dig gold, not to take keer of cripples.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Yank, we&#8217;ll fix it somehow,&#8221; I agreed.
&#8220;Now if you&#8217;re all right, Johnny and I will just go and straighten
out our camp things a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were now, it will be remembered, without horses. Don Gaspar had unpacked
our few belongings before <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_263'></a>263</span> departing. Johnny and I found a good camping place,
then carried the stuff over on our backs. We cooked ourselves some food, lit
pipes, and sat down to talk the situation over.</p>

<p>We got nowhere. As a matter of fact, we were both in the dead-water of
reaction from hard, long-continued labour, and we could not bring ourselves to
face with any enthusiasm the resuming of gold washing. Revulsion shook us at the
mere thought of getting down in a hot, glaring ravine and moving heavy earth and
rocks. Yet we had not made a fortune, nor much of a beginning at one, and
neither of us was what is known as a quitter. We realized perfectly that we
would go on gold mining.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we need is a recess,&#8221; Johnny ended, &#8220;and I move we
take it. Just let&#8217;s camp here, and loaf for a few days or a week, and see
how Yank gets along, and then we can go back to Porcupine.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though this decision lifted a great weight, we sat back on our shoulder
blades with a sigh of relief, and blew tobacco smoke straight up in the air for
at least fifteen minutes. By the end of that time we, being young and restless,
felt thoroughly refreshed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go look this outfit over,&#8221; suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>We gravitated naturally to the diggings, which were very much like those at
Hangman&#8217;s Gulch, except that they were rather more extensive, and branched
out more into the tributary ravines. The men working there were, many of them,
of a much better type than those we had seen in town; though even here was a
large element of rough-looking, wild, reckless customers. We wandered <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span> about here and there,
our hands in our pockets, a vast leisure filling our souls. With some of the
more pleasant-appearing miners we conversed. They told us that the diggings were
rich, good &#8220;ounce a day&#8221; diggings. We saw a good many cradles in
use. It was easy to tell the old-timers from the riffraff of newcomers. A great
many of the latter seemed to lack the steadiness of purpose characteristic of
nearly all the first rush. They worked haphazardly, spasmodically, pulling and
hauling against each other. Some should not have been working at all, for their
eyes were sunken in their heads from illness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to hustle now,&#8221; they told us. &#8220;We can take
a good rest when the rains stop work.&#8221;</p>

<p>We noticed especially a marked change in demeanour among some of the groups.
In the early part of the summer every man answered every man good-naturedly,
except he happened to have a next day&#8217;s head or some other sort of a
personal grouch. Now many compact little groups of men worked quite apart. When
addressed they merely scowled or looked sullen, evidently quite unwilling to
fraternize with the chance-comer.</p>

<p>We loafed about here and there through the diggings, swapping remarks with
the better disposed, until the men began to knock off work. Then we returned
through the village.</p>

<p>Its street had begun to fill. Here, too, we could not but be struck by the
subtle change that had come over the spirit of the people. All used to seem like
the members of a big family, good-natured and approachable even when strangers.
Now a slower acquaintance must precede familiarity. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span> We seemed out of it because we did not
know anybody, something we had not felt before in a mining camp. There was no
hostility in this, not an iota; only now it had evidently become necessary to
hold a man off a little until one knew something about him. People seemed,
somehow, <i>watchful</i>, in spite of the surface air of good-nature and of
boisterous spirits. We did not quite understand this at the moment, but we
learned more about it later.</p>

<p>We sauntered along peering into the various buildings. The saloons were here
more elaborate than at Hangman&#8217;s, the gambling places larger, and with
some slight attempt at San Francisco splendour. That is to say, there were large
gilt-framed mirrors on the walls, nude pictures, and in some cases a stage for
musical performers. One of the three stores was devoted entirely to clothing and
&#8220;notions,&#8221; to us a new departure in specialization. We were sadly in
need of garments, so we entered, and were at once met by a very oily, suave
specimen of the chosen people. When we had escaped from this robber&#8217;s den
we looked at each other in humorous dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad Yank don&#8217;t need clothes, anyway,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>We were, it will be remembered, out of provisions, so we entered also one of
the general stores to lay in a small supply. The proprietor proved to be an old
friend, Jones, the storekeeper at Hangman&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which,&#8221; said Johnny shrewdly, &#8220;is a sad commentary on the
decline of the diggings at Hangman&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jones was evidently prosperous, and doing business on a much larger scale
than at the old place; for in his <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_266'></a>266</span> commodious building were quantities of goods
displayed and many barrels and boxes still unopened. He did not recognize us, of
course; and we had to await the completion of a tale he was telling a group
perched on the counters and on the boxes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got a consignment of mixed goods from Mellin,&#8221; he was saying,
&#8220;and one of the barrels wasn&#8217;t marked with anything I could make
out. I knocked the top in, and chucked her out behind for spoiled beef.
Certainly stunk like it. Well, sir, that barrel lay there for a good ten days;
and then one day up drifted a Dutchman with a brogue on him thick enough to
plant flag-poles in. &#8216;How mooch,&#8217; says he &#8216;is dot stoof?&#8217; &#8216;What
stuff?&#8217; says I. &#8216;Dot stoof oudt behind.&#8217; &#8216;I ain&#8217;t got no stuff
out behind! What&#8217;s eating you?&#8217; says I. Then he points out that
spoiled beef. &#8216;Good Lord!&#8217; says I, &#8216;help yourself. I got a lot of nerve,
but not enough to charge a man for anything that stinks like that beef. But you
better let it alone; you&#8217;ll get sick!&#8217; Well, sir, you wouldn&#8217;t
think there was any Dutchmen in the country, now would you? but they came to
that stink like flies to molasses. Any time I&#8217;d look out the back door
I&#8217;d see one or two nosing around that old spoiled beef. Then one day
another old beer-belly sagged in. &#8216;Say, you got any more barrels of dot
sauerkraut?&#8217; he wants to know. &#8216;That what?&#8217; I asks. &#8216;Dot
sauerkraut,&#8217; says he, &#8216;like dot in the backyard. I gif you goot price for
a whole barrel,&#8217; says he. And here I&#8217;d give away a whole barrel! I
might&#8217;ve got a dollar a pound for the stuff. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t know
what it might be worth to a Dutchman.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>He turned away
to wait on us.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t guess there was so many Dutchmen in the
country!&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>We paid his terrible prices for our few necessities, and went out. The music
was beginning to tune up from the gambling places and saloons. It reminded us of
our Italian friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me his place was right here where we are,&#8221; puzzled
Johnny. &#8220;Hanged if I don&#8217;t believe this is the place; only
they&#8217;ve stuck a veranda roof on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We turned into the entrance of the hotel, to find ourselves in the
well-remembered long, low room wherein we had spent the evening a few months
before. It was now furnished with a bar, the flimsy partitions had been knocked
out, and evidently additions had been constructed beyond the various closed
doors. The most conspicuous single thing was a huge bulletin board occupying one
whole end. It was written over closely with hundreds and hundreds of names.
Several men were laboriously spelling them out. This, we were given to
understand, was a sort of register of the overland immigrants; and by its means
many parties obtained first news of scattered members.</p>

<p>The man behind the bar looked vaguely familiar to me, but I could not place
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the proprietor of this place?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>He indicated a short, blowsy, truculent-looking individual who was, at the
moment, staring out the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;There used to be an Italian&#x2500;&#8221; I began.</p>

<p>The barkeeper uttered a short barking laugh as he turned to attend to a
customer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>&#8220;He found
the climate bad for his heart&#8211;and sold out!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>On the wall opposite was posted a number of printed and written handbills. We
stopped idly to examine them. They had in general to do with lost property,
stolen horses, and rewards for the apprehension of various individuals. One
struck us in particular. It was issued by a citizens&#8217; committee of San
Francisco, and announced a general reward for the capture of any member of the
&#8220;Hounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if they&#8217;d got tired of that gang down there,&#8221;
Johnny observed. &#8220;They were ruling the roost when we left. Do you know, I
saw one of those fellows this afternoon&#8211;perhaps you remember him&#8211;a
man with a queer sort of blue scar over one cheekbone. I swear I saw him in San
Francisco. There&#8217;s our chance to make some money, Jim.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proprietor of the hotel turned to look at Johnny curiously, and several
of the loafers drinking at the bar glanced in the direction of his clear young
voice. We went on reading and enjoying the notices, some of which were very
quaint. Suddenly the door burst open to admit a big man followed closely by a
motley rabble. The leader was a red-faced, burly, whiskered individual, with a
red beard and matted hair. As he turned I saw a star-shaped blue scar above his
cheekbone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the &#x2500; &#x2500; &#x2500; that is going to make
some money out of arresting me?&#8221; he roared, swinging his huge form
ostentatiously toward the centre of the room.</p>

<p>I confessed I was aghast, and completely at a loss. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span> A row was evidently unavoidable, and
the odds were against us. Almost at the instant the door came open, Johnny,
without waiting for hostile demonstration, jerked his Colt&#8217;s revolvers
from their holsters. With one bound he reached the centre of the room, and
thrust the muzzles beneath the bully&#8217;s nose. His black eyes were
snapping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up, you hound!&#8221; he said in a low, even voice. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t condescend to make money out of your miserable carcass, except at
a glue factory. And if you or your friends so much as wink an eyelid, I&#8217;ll
put you in shape for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Caught absolutely by surprise, the &#8220;Hound&#8221; stared fascinated into
the pistol barrels, his jaw dropped, his face redder than ever, his eyes
ridiculously protruding. I had recovered my wits and had backed against the
bulletin board, a revolver in either hand, keeping an eye on the general
company. Those who had burst in with the bully had stopped frozen in their
tracks. The others were interested, but not particularly excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay in this camp,&#8221; Johnny advised crisply,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m not going to be bothered by big bluffs like you. I warn
you, and all like you, to let me alone and keep away from me. You stay in camp,
or you can leave camp, just as you please, but I warn you that I shoot you next
time I lay eyes on you. Now, about face! March!&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s voice had an edge of steel. The big man obeyed orders
implicitly. He turned slowly, and sneaked out the door. His followers shambled
toward the bar. Johnny passed them rather contemptuously under the review of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span> his snapping eyes,
and they shambled a trifle faster. Then, with elaborate nonchalance, we
sauntered out.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord, Johnny!&#8221; I cried when we had reached the street,
&#8220;that was fine! I didn&#8217;t know you had it in you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn the luck!&#8221; he cried, kicking a tin can. &#8220;Oh,
<i>damn</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He muttered to himself a moment, then turned to me with humorous despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a stupid, useless mess!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The minute that
fellow came into the room I saw we were let in for a row; so I went at it quick
before he had got organized. He didn&#8217;t expect that. He thought he&#8217;d
have to work us into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly got him,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it just starts us all wrong here,&#8221; complained Johnny.
&#8220;We are marked men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to look out for him a little. I don&#8217;t
believe he&#8217;s really dangerous. He looks to me a lot like a
bluffer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, him!&#8221; said Johnny contemputously, &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t
worry me any. It&#8217;s all the rest of them. I&#8217;ve practically challenged
all the hard cases in camp, don&#8217;t you see? I&#8217;m no longer an
inconspicuous newcomer. Every tough character with any real nerve will want to
tackle me now, just to try me out.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the impulsive and unanalytical Johnny this was surprising enough, and my
face must have showed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen it worked out in my part of the country,&#8221; he
explained sombrely. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to bother with that sort of thing.
I&#8217;m a peaceable citizen. Now I&#8217;ve <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_271'></a>271</span> got to walk around on tiptoe all the time watching
for trouble. Oh, <i>damn</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re afraid&#x2500;&#8221; I began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid,&#8221; said Johnny so simply that I believed him
at once. &#8220;But I&#8217;m annoyed. And of course you recognized that
barkeeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d seen him before, but I don&#8217;t remember just
where.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of those fellows we fired out of our canoe down at
Chagres. You can bet he doesn&#8217;t love us any!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You move along to Porcupine to-morrow,&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;I
can look after Yank all right. They won&#8217;t bother me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny walked for some steps in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, they won&#8217;t bother you,&#8221; he repeated slowly.</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, then he threw back his head. &#8220;But look here,
Jim,&#8221; he said briskly, &#8220;you forget. I told that fellow and his
friends that I was going to live in this place. I can&#8217;t leave
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said I. &#8220;What do you care for that
gang?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would look like running away. No, I certainly don&#8217;t intend to
leave now.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span><a id='link_29'></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CHALLENGE</span></h2>

<p>We went out to see Yank, with the full intention of spending the evening and
cheering him up. He was dozing, restless, waking and sleeping by fits and
starts. We sat around in the awkward fashion peculiar to very young boys in the
sickroom; and then, to our vast relief, were shoved out by Señora Moreña. With
her we held a whispered conversation outside, and completed satisfactory
arrangements for Yank&#8217;s keep. She was a chuckling, easy-going, motherly
sort of creature, and we were very lucky to have her. Then we returned in the
gathering dusk to our camp under the trees across the way.</p>

<p>A man rose from a seat against a tree trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Good</i> evenin&#8217;, stranger,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; responded Johnny guardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the man who stuck up Scar-face Charley in Morton&#8217;s
place, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that to you?&#8221; replied Johnny. &#8220;Are you a
friend of his?&#8221;</p>

<p>His habitual air of young carelessness had fallen from him; his eye was
steady and frosty, his face set in stern lines. Before my wondering eyes he had
grown ten years older in the last six hours. The other was lounging toward
us&#8211;a short, slight man, with flaxen moustache and eyebrows, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span> a colourless face, pale
blue eyes, and a bald forehead from which the hat had been pushed back. He was
chewing a straw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I was just inquirin&#8217; in a friendly sort of way,&#8221;
replied the newcomer peaceably.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know you,&#8221; stated Johnny shortly, &#8220;nor who
you&#8217;re friends to, nor your camp. I deny your right to ask questions. Good
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good night,&#8221; agreed the other, still peaceable. &#8220;I
reckon I gather considerable about you, anyhow.&#8221; He turned away. &#8220;I
had a notion from what I heard that you was sort of picked on, and I dropped
round, sort of friendly like; but Lord love you! I don&#8217;t care how many of
you desperadoes kill each other. Go to it, and good riddance!&#8221; He cast his
pale blue eyes on Johnny&#8217;s rigid figure. &#8220;Also, go to hell!&#8221;
he remarked dispassionately.</p>

<p>Johnny stared at him puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he called, after a moment. &#8220;Then you&#8217;re
not a friend of this Hound?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger turned in slow surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me? What are you talking about?&#8221; He looked from one to the other
of us, then returned the few steps he had taken. &#8220;I believe you
don&#8217;t know me. I&#8217;m Randall, Danny Randall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; puzzled Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of Sonoma,&#8221; added Randall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I should know you, but I&#8217;m afraid I
don&#8217;t,&#8221; confessed Johnny.</p>

<p>Randall turned back to the tree beneath which lay our effects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>&#8220;I believe
I&#8217;ll just have a cup of coffee with you boys,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>We blew up the fire, scoured the frying pan, made ourselves food. Randall
brought a pail of water. We all ate together, without much conversation; then
lit our pipes and piled on dry wood to make a brighter friendship fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, boys,&#8221; said Randall, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to ask you some
questions; and you can answer me or not, just as you please. Only I&#8217;ll
say, it isn&#8217;t just curiosity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny, who was studying him covertly from beneath the shadow of his hat,
nodded briefly, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been in the mines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since March.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since March!&#8221; echoed Randall, as though a little bewildered at
this reply. &#8220;Yet you never heard&#x2500;What camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny studied a while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hangman&#8217;s Gulch for six weeks,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Then just
prospecting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll answer that question,&#8221; replied
Johnny slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But somewhere back in the hills?&#8221; persisted Randall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhere back in the hills,&#8221; agreed Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me&#x2500;&#8221; I broke in, but Johnny silenced me with a
gesture. He was watching Randall intently, and thinking hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have been out of it for three months or so. That explains it.
Now I don&#8217;t mind telling you I came <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_275'></a>275</span> up here this evening to size you up. I heard about
your row with Scar-face Charley, and I wanted to see whether you were just
another fighting desperado or an honest man. Well, I&#8217;m satisfied.
I&#8217;m not going to ask you if you have much gold with you, for you
wouldn&#8217;t tell me; but if you have, keep it with you. If you don&#8217;t,
you&#8217;ll lose it. Keep in the middle of the road, and out of dark places.
This is a tough camp; but there are a lot of us good men, too, and my business
is to get us all to know each other. Things are getting bad, and we&#8217;ve got
to get together. That&#8217;s why I came up to see you. Are you handy with a
gun?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need to be. Let&#8217;s see if you are. Stand up. Try to get the
draw on me. Now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny reached for his pistol, but before his hand was fairly on the butt,
Randall had thrust the muzzle of a small revolver beneath his nose. His pale
blue eyes had lit with concentration, his bleached eyebrows were drawn together.
For an instant the thought flashed across my mind that this was a genuine
hold-up; and I am sure Johnny caught the same suspicion, for his figure
stiffened. Then Randall dropped his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very pretty,&#8221; said Johnny coolly. &#8220;How did you do that? I
didn&#8217;t catch your motion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the sleeve,&#8221; said Randall. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult, but
it&#8217;s pretty, as you say; and if you learn to draw from the sleeve,
I&#8217;ll guarantee you&#8217;ll get the draw on your man every
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me,&#8221; said Johnny simply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>&#8220;That gun
of yours is too big; it&#8217;s a holster weapon. Here, take this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed Johnny a beautifully balanced small Colt&#8217;s revolver,
engraved, silver-plated, with polished rosewood handles. This he showed Johnny
how to stow away in the sleeve, how to arrange it, how to grasp it, and the
exact motion in snatching it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes practice, lots of it, and then more of it,&#8221; said
Randall. &#8220;It&#8217;s worse than useless unless you get it just right. If
you made a mistake at the wrong time, the other man would get you
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where can I get one of these?&#8221; asked Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Randall approved his decision. &#8220;You see the
necessity. You can&#8217;t. But a derringer is about as good, and Jones has them
for sale. Now as for your holster gun: the whole trick of quick drawing is to
throw your right shoulder forward and <i>drag</i> the gun from the holster with
one forward sweep. Don&#8217;t lift it up and out. This way!&#8221; He snapped
his hand past his hip and brought it away armed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty,&#8221; repeated Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste much powder and ball shooting at a mark,&#8221;
advised Randall. &#8220;It looks nice to cut out the ace of hearts at ten yards,
but it doesn&#8217;t mean much. If you can shoot at all, you can shoot straight
enough to hit a man at close range. Practise the draw.&#8221; He turned to me.
&#8220;You&#8217;d better practise, too. Every man&#8217;s got to take care of
himself these days. But you&#8217;re not due for trouble same as your friend
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not. Now it&#8217;s up to you. I judged you <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span> didn&#8217;t know
conditions here, and I thought it only right to warn you. There&#8217;s lots of
good fellows in this camp; and some of the hard cases are a pretty good sort.
Just keep organized, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I wonder who Danny Randall is!&#8221; speculated Johnny after our
visitor had departed. &#8220;He talked as though we ought to know all about it.
I&#8217;m going to find out the first fellow I get acquainted with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next morning we asked the Moreñas who was Danny Randall.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>El diabolo</i>,&#8221; replied Moreña shortly; and trudged
obstinately away to his work without vouchsafing further information.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is interesting, but indefinite,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>We found Yank easier in body, and embarked on the sea of patience in which he
was to float becalmed until his time was up. In reply to his inquiries as to our
plans, we told him we were resting a few days, which was the truth. Then we went
up to town and made two purchases; a small tent, and a derringer pistol. They
cost us three hundred and fifty dollars. It was the quiet time of day; the
miners had gone to work, and most of the gentlemen of leisure were not yet
about. Nevertheless a dozen or so sat against the walls, smoking paper
cigarettos. They all looked at us curiously; and several nodded at Johnny in a
brief, tentative sort of fashion.</p>

<p>The rest of the day, and of several days following, we spent in putting up
our tent, ditching it, arranging our cooking affairs, building rough seats, and
generally making ourselves comfortable. We stretched these things to cover <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span> as long a space of time
as possible, for we secretly dreaded facing the resumption of the old grind, and
postponed it as long as we could. A good deal of the time we spent at
Yank&#8217;s bedside, generally sitting silent and constrained, to the mutual
discomfort of all three of us, I am sure. At odd intervals we practised
conscientiously and solemnly at the &#8220;draw.&#8221; We would stand facing
each other, the nipples of our revolvers uncapped, and would, at the given word,
see who could cover the other first. We took turns at giving the word. At first
we were not far apart; but Johnny quickly passed me in skill. I am always
somewhat clumsy, but my friend was naturally quick and keen at all games of
skill or dexterity. He was the sort of man who could bowl, or play pool, or
billiards, or anything else rather better than the average accustomed player the
first time he tried. He turned card tricks deftly. At the end of our three
days&#8217; loafing he caught me at the end of his pistol so regularly that
there ceased to be any contest in it. I never did get the sleeve trick; but
then, I never succeeded in fooling the merest infant with any of my attempts at
legerdemain. Johnny could flip that little derringer out with a twist of his
supple wrist as neatly as a snake darts its forked tongue. For ten minutes at a
time he practised it, over and over, as regularly as well-oiled machinery.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that proves nothing as to how it would work out in real
action,&#8221; said Johnny thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the third day, while we were resting from the heat beneath
the shade of our tree, we were approached by three men.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;THE BIG MAN WHIRLED TO THE FLOOR&#8221;
</p></div><!-- figure -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>&#8220;Howdy,
boys,&#8221; said the first. &#8220;We hain&#8217;t seen you around camp lately,
and thought mebbe you&#8217;d flew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are still here,&#8221; replied Johnny with smooth politeness.
&#8220;As you see, we have been fixing our quarters to stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scar-face Charley is here, too,&#8221; observed the spokesman,
&#8220;and he wanted me to tell you that he is going to be at the Bella Union at
eight this evenin&#8217;, and he wants to know, will he see you? and to come
heeled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, gentlemen,&#8221; replied Johnny quietly. &#8220;If by
accident you should happen to see the desperado in question&#8211;who, I assume,
can be in no way your friend&#8211;I hope you will tell him that I, too, will be
at the Bella Union at eight o&#8217;clock, and that I will come
heeled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; alone?&#8221; said the man, &#8220;or
p&#8217;rhaps yore friend&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend, as you call him, is simply a miner, and has nothing to do
with this,&#8221; interrupted Johnny emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, sir,&#8221; said the spokesman, rising.</p>

<p>The other two, who had throughout said no word, followed his example.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know Danny Randall?&#8221; asked Johnny as they moved off.</p>

<p>If he had presented his derringer under their noses, they could not have
stopped more suddenly. They stared at each other a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he a friend of yours?&#8221; inquired the spokesman after an
uncertain moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He likes fair play,&#8221; said Johnny enigmatically.</p>

<p>The trio moved off in the direction of town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>&#8220;We
don&#8217;t know any more about Danny Randall than we did,&#8221; observed
Johnny, &#8220;but I tried a shot in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be there;
and you want to make up your mind to just that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come, of course,&#8221; agreed Johnny. &#8220;I suppose I
cannot keep you from that. But Jim,&#8221; he commanded earnestly, &#8220;you
must swear to keep out of the row, unless it develops into a general one; and
you must swear not to speak to me or make any sign no matter what happens. I
must play a lone hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was firm on this point; and in the end I gave my promise, to his evident
relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is our visitors&#8217; day, evidently,&#8221; he observed.
&#8220;Here come two more men. One of them is the doctor; I&#8217;d know that
hat two miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other is our friend Danny Randall,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Dr. Rankin greeted us with a cordiality I had not suspected in him. Randall
nodded in his usual diffident fashion, and slid into the oak shadow, where he
squatted on his heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;About this Scar-face Charley,&#8221; he said abruptly, &#8220;I hear
he&#8217;s issued his defi, and you&#8217;ve taken him up. Do you know anything
about this sort of thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit,&#8221; admitted Johnny frankly. &#8220;Is it a duel; and
are you gentleman here to act as my seconds?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not,&#8221; stated the downright doctor. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
barroom murder and you cannot get around it; and I, for one, don&#8217;t try.
But now you&#8217;re in for it, and you&#8217;ve got to go through with
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend to,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_281'></a>281</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not precisely that,&#8221;
objected Danny Randall, &#8220;for, d&#8217;ye see, he&#8217;s sent you
warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about all the warning you&#8217;ll get!&#8221; snorted the
doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a sort of rule about it,&#8221; persisted Randall.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m here to tell you. He&#8217;ll try to come
up on you suddenly, probably from behind; and he&#8217;ll say &#8216;draw and defend
yourself,&#8217; and shoot you as soon after that as he can. You want to see him
first, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; exploded the doctor, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t kill that
fellow, by the Eternal, when you get a chance&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll give him a pill, Doctor,&#8221; interrupted Randall, with
a little chuckle. &#8220;But look here,&#8221; he said to Johnny, &#8220;after
all, this sort of a mess isn&#8217;t required of you. You say the word and
I&#8217;ll take on this Scar-face Charley and run him out of town. He&#8217;s a
good deal of a pest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Johnny stiffly; &#8220;I intend to paddle my
own canoe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as we can help you any more,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I just thought you ought to be on to the way it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you,&#8221; said Johnny warmly. &#8220;The only
doubt in my mind was when I was privileged to open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d pot him through the window with a shotgun first chance I
got,&#8221; stated the doctor; &#8220;that sort of a ruffian is just like a mad
dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you would, Doctor,&#8221; said Randall with just the
faintest suspicion of sarcasm in his voice. &#8220;Well, I guess we&#8217;ll be
toddling.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>But I wanted
some information, and I meant to have it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is this Scar-face Charley,&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got me,&#8221; replied Randall; &#8220;you fellows seemed to recognize
him. Only he&#8217;s one of the gang, undoubtedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The gang?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the general run of hangers-on. Nobody knows how they live, but
every one suspects. Some of them work, but not many. There are a heap of
disappearances that no one knows anything about; and every once in a while a man
is found drowned and floating; <i>floating</i> mind you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that?&#8221; I asked; &#8220;drowned bodies usually
float.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no miner in these diggings but has gold enough in his
belt to sink him. If a man floats, he&#8217;s been robbed, and you can tie to
that reasoning. And the fellows are all well mounted, and given to mysterious
disappearances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; broke in the doctor, &#8220;they are an
organized band of cut-throats and highway robbers making this honest camp a
headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw, Doctor,&#8221; said Randall, &#8220;that&#8217;s by no means
certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certain enough,&#8221; insisted the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think the miners would drive them out,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive them out!&#8221; cried the doctor bitterly; &#8220;they&#8217;re
too busy, and their own toes haven&#8217;t been trodden on, and they&#8217;re
too willing to let well enough alone so as not to be interrupted in their
confounded digging for gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not organized and they are quite justly unwilling to get
in a row with that gang when they know they&#8217;d be killed,&#8221; stated
Randall quietly. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting on &#8216;well enough,&#8217; and
they&#8217;ll continue to be run by this lot <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_283'></a>283</span> of desperadoes until something desperate happens.
They want to be let alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor recovered his equanimity with an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;They present the curious spectacle,&#8221; said he thoughtfully,
&#8220;of the individual man in a new untrammelled liberty trying to escape his
moral obligations to society. He escapes them for a while, but they are there;
and in the end he must pay in violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Randall laughed and arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the doctor is going to begin that sort of thing, I&#8217;m
going,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Our visitors took their departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Doctor, one moment!&#8221; I called; then, as he returned.
&#8220;Tell me, who and what is Danny Randall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Danny Randall,&#8221; said the doctor, a humorous twinkle coming into
his eyes, &#8220;is a gentleman of fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now we know a lot more than we did before!&#8221; said Johnny, as
we watched the receding figures.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span><a id='link_30'></a>CHAPTER XXX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FIGHT</span></h2>

<p>We ate a very silent supper, washed our dishes methodically, and walked up to
town. The Bella Union was the largest of the three gambling houses&#8211;a log
and canvas structure some forty feet long by perhaps twenty wide. A bar extended
across one end, and the gaming tables were arranged down the middle. A dozen oil
lamps with reflectors furnished illumination.</p>

<p>All five tables were doing a brisk business; when we paused at the door for a
preliminary survey, the bar was lined with drinkers, and groups of twos and
threes were slowly sauntering here and there or conversing at the tops of their
voices with many guffaws. The air was thick with tobacco smoke. Johnny stepped
just inside the door, moved sideways, and so stood with his back to the wall.
His keen eyes went from group to group slowly, resting for a moment in turn on
each of the five impassive gamblers and their lookouts, on the two barkeepers,
and then one by one on the men with whom the place was crowded. Following his,
my glance recognized at a corner of the bar Danny Randall with five
rough-looking miners. He caught my eye and nodded. No one else appeared to
notice us, though I imagined the noise of the place sank and rose again at the
first moment of our entrance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_285'></a>285</span>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said Johnny to me quietly,
&#8220;there&#8217;s Danny Randall at the other end of the room. Go join him. I
want you to leave me to play my own game.&#8221;</p>

<p>I started to object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do as I say,&#8221; insisted Johnny. &#8220;I can take care of
myself unless there&#8217;s a general row. In that case all my friends are
better together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without further protest I left him, and edged my way to the little group at
the end of the bar. Randall nodded to me as I came up, and motioned to the
barkeeper to set me out a glass, but said nothing. Ours was the only lot away
from the gaming tables not talking. We sipped our drink and watched Johnny.</p>

<p>After surveying coolly the room, Johnny advanced to the farther of the
gambling tables, and began to play. His back was toward the entrance. The game
was roulette, and Johnny tossed down his bets methodically, studying with
apparent absorption each shift of the wheel. To all appearance he was intent on
the game, and nothing else; and he talked and laughed with his neighbours and
the dealer as though his spirit were quite carefree.</p>

<p>For ten minutes we watched. Then a huge figure appeared in the blackness of
the doorway, slipped through, and instantly to one side, so that his back was to
the wall. Scar-face Charley had arrived.</p>

<p>He surveyed the place as we had done, almost instantly caught sight of
Johnny, and immediately began to make his way across the room through the crowds
of loungers. Johnny was laying a bet, bending over the table, joking with the
impassive dealer, his back turned to the door, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_286'></a>286</span> totally oblivious of his enemy&#8217;s approach. I
started forward, instantly realized the hopelessness of either getting quickly
through that crowd or of making myself heard, and leaned back, clutching the
rail with both hands. Johnny was hesitating, his hand hovering uncertainly above
the marked squares of the layout, in doubt exactly where to bet. Scar-face
Charley shouldered his way through the loungers and reached the clear space
immediately behind his unconscious victim. He stopped for an instant, squared
his shoulders, and took one step forward. Johnny dropped his chips on the felt
layout, contemplated his choice an instant&#8211;and suddenly whirled on his
heel in a lightning about-face.</p>

<p>Although momentarily startled by this unexpected evidence that Johnny was not
so far off guard as he had seemed, the desperado&#8217;s hand dropped swiftly to
the butt of his pistol. At the same instant Johnny&#8217;s arm snapped forward
in the familiar motion of drawing from the sleeve. The motion started clean and
smooth, but half through, caught, dragged, halted. I gasped aloud, but had time
for no more than that; Scar-face Charley&#8217;s revolver was already on the
leap. Then at last Johnny&#8217;s derringer appeared, apparently as the result
of a desperate effort. Almost with the motion, it barked, and the big man
whirled to the floor, his pistol, already at half raise, clattering away. The
whole episode from the beginning occupied the space of two eye-winks. Probably
no one but myself and Danny Randall could have caught the slight hitch in
Johnny&#8217;s draw; and indeed I doubt if anybody saw whence he had snatched
the derringer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>A complete
silence fell. It could have lasted only an instant; but Johnny seized that
instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has this man any friends here?&#8221; he asked clearly.</p>

<p>His head was back, and his snapping black eyes seemed to see everywhere at
once.</p>

<p>No one answered or stirred. Johnny held them for perhaps ten seconds, then
deliberately turned back to the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my bet on the <i>even</i>,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Let her
roll!&#8221;</p>

<p>The gambler lifted his face, white in the brilliant illumination directly
over his head, and I thought to catch a flicker of something like admiration in
his passionless eyes. Then with his left hand he spun the wheel.</p>

<p>The soft, dull whir and tiny clicking of the ball as it rebounded from the
metal grooves struck across the tense stillness. As though this was the
releasing signal, a roar of activity burst forth. Men all talked at once. The
other tables and the bar were deserted, and everybody crowded down toward the
lower end of the room. Danny Randall and his friends rushed determinedly to the
centre of disturbance. Some men were carrying out Scar-face Charley. Others were
talking excitedly. A little clear space surrounded the roulette table, at which,
as may be imagined, Johnny was now the only player. Quite methodically he laid
three more bets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s enough for now,&#8221; he told the dealer
pleasantly, and turned away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo! Randall! hullo! Frank!&#8221; he greeted us. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
just won three bets straight. Let&#8217;s have a drink. Bring your
friends,&#8221; he told Randall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>We turned toward
the bar and way was instantly made for us. Johnny poured himself a big drink of
whiskey. A number of curious men, mere boys most of them, had crowded close
after us, and were standing staring at Johnny with a curiosity they made slight
attempt to conceal. Johnny suddenly turned to them, holding high his whiskey in
a hand as steady as a rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to crime, boys!&#8221; he said, and drank it down at a
gulp. Then he stood staring them uncomprisingly in the face, until they had
slunk away. He called for and drank another whiskey, then abruptly moved toward
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go turn in,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he said to Randall and his friends, who had
followed us. &#8220;No, I am obliged to you,&#8221; he replied to a suggestion,
&#8220;but I need no escort,&#8221; and he said it so firmly that all but
Randall went back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to your camp with you, whether you need an escort or
not,&#8221; said the latter.</p>

<p>Without a word Johnny walked away down the street, very straight. We hurried
to catch up with him; and just as we did so he collapsed to the ground and was
suddenly and violently sick. As I helped him to his feet, I could feel that his
arm was trembling violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord, fellows! I&#8217;m ashamed,&#8221; he gasped a little
hysterically. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I had so little nerve!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nerve!&#8221; suddenly roared Danny Randall; &#8220;confound your
confounded impudence! If I ever hear you say another word like that, I&#8217;ll
put a head on you, if it&#8217;s the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_289'></a>289</span> last act of my life! You&#8217;re the gamest little
chicken in this roost, and I&#8217;ll make you beg like a hound if you say you
aren&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny laughed a little uncertainly over this contradiction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I kill him?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, worse luck; just bored him through the collarbone. That heavy
little derringer ball knocked him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which I am <i>not</i>,&#8221; stated Danny Randall with emphasis.
&#8220;You ought to have killed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to you I wasn&#8217;t killed myself. I couldn&#8217;t have
hoped to get the draw on him with my holster gun. He is as quick as a
snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were going to bungle it,&#8221; said Randall.
&#8220;What was the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Front sight caught at the edge of my sleeve. I had to tear it loose by
main strength. I&#8217;m going to file it off. What&#8217;s the use of a front
sight at close range?&#8221;</p>

<p>I heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want ever to be so scared again,&#8221; I
confessed. &#8220;Will you tell me, by all that&#8217;s holy, <i>why</i> you
turned your back on the door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Johnny seriously, &#8220;I wanted to get him close
to me. If I had shown him that I&#8217;d seen him when he first came in the
door, he&#8217;d have opened fire at once. And I&#8217;m a rotten shot. But I
figured that if he thought I didn&#8217;t see him, he&#8217;d come across the
room to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he nearly got you by surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Johnny; &#8220;I saw him all the time. I <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span> got his reflection from
the glass over that picture of the beautiful lady sitting on the Old Crow
Whiskey barrel. That&#8217;s why I picked out that table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; cried Danny Randall delightedly, &#8220;you&#8217;re a
true sport. You&#8217;ve got a head, you have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;I figured I&#8217;d have to do
<i>something</i>; I&#8217;m such a rotten shot.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span><a id='link_31'></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE EXPRESS MESSENGER</span></h2>

<p>We slept late the following morning, and awoke tired, as though we had been
on a long journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Johnny, when our after-breakfast pipes had been lit,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got to get together. There&#8217;s two serious questions
before the house: the first and most important is, who and what is Danny
Randall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you there,&#8221; said I heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the second is, what are we going to do with ourselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to begin mining,&#8221; I stated.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, old strong-arm; I am not. I&#8217;m dead sick of cricking
my back and blistering my hands. It isn&#8217;t my kind of work; and the only
reason I ever thought it was is because the stuff we dig is called
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t going to lie down?&#8221; I cried incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, old sport, I&#8217;m not going to lie down. I came out here to
make my fortune; but I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve got to dig gold to do
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; confessed Johnny, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll be able to inform you in a few days. I suppose you&#8217;ll be going
back to the Porcupine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; said I seriously. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
believe the Porcupine is any richer than these diggings, and it&#8217;s mighty
uncertain. I believe a man&#8217;s more apt to keep what he gets here, and
there&#8217;s a lot more company, and&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words, you&#8217;re going to stick around old Yank or know
the reason why!&#8221; interrupted Johnny with a little smile.</p>

<p>I flushed, hesitated, then blurted out: &#8220;Well, yes. I shouldn&#8217;t
be easy about him here by himself. It strikes me this is a tough camp, and
almost anything&#8217;s likely to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel the same way,&#8221; confessed Johnny. &#8220;We&#8217;re all
partners. All right; &#8216;stick&#8217; it is. We&#8217;ll have to be mighty
plausible to keep Yank quiet. That&#8217;s agreed,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;Now
I&#8217;m going up to town to find out about Danny Randall, and incidentally to
look around for something to do. You&#8217;re a good steady liar; you go over
and talk to Yank.&#8221;</p>

<p>We separated until noon. I had no great difficulty with Yank, either because
I was, as Johnny said, a plausible liar, or because Yank was secretly glad to
have us near. After visiting with him a while I took the axe and set about the
construction of a cradle. Johnny returned near twelve o&#8217;clock to find me
at this useful occupation.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to Danny Randall,&#8221; he began at once, squatting near by:
&#8220;Origin lost in mists of obscurity. First known in this country as guide
to a party of overland immigrants before the gold discovery. One of the original
Bear Flag revolutionists. Member of Fremont&#8217;s raiders in the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span> south. Showed up again
at Sonoma and headed a dozen forays after the horse-thieving Indians and
half-breeds in the San Joaquin. Seems now to follow the mines. Guaranteed the
best shot with rifle or pistol in the state. Guaranteed the best courage and the
quietest manners in the state. Very eminent and square in his profession.
That&#8217;s his entire history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his profession?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He runs the Bella Union.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gambler?&#8221; I cried, astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so&#8211;a square gambler.&#8221;</p>

<p>I digested this in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you discover anything for yourself?&#8221; I asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Best job ever invented,&#8221; said Johnny triumphantly, &#8220;at
three ounces a day; and I can&#8217;t beat that at your beastly
digging.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I invented it myself, too,&#8221; went on Johnny proudly. &#8220;You
remember what Randall&#8211;or the doctor&#8211;said about the robberies, and
the bodies of the drowned men floating? Well, every man carries his dust around
in a belt because he dare not do anything else with it. I do myself, and so do
you; and you&#8217;ll agree that it weighs like the mischief. So I went to
Randall and I suggested that we start an express service to get the stuff out to
bank with some good firm in San Francisco. He fell in with the idea in a minute.
My first notion was that we take it right through to San Francisco ourselves;
but he says he can make satisfactory arrangements to send it in from Sacramento.
That&#8217;s about sixty miles; and we&#8217;ll call it <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span> a day&#8217;s hard ride through this
country, with a change of horses. So now I&#8217;m what you might call an
express messenger&#8211;at three good ounces a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll be killed and robbed!&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s eyes were dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of the fun!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a rotten shot,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to practise, under Danny Randall, from now until the first
trip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think we&#8217;ll advertise the date? Of course I&#8217;d tell
you, Jim; but honestly I don&#8217;t know yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since the matter seemed settled, and Johnny delighted, I said no more. My
cradle occupied me for three days longer. In that length of time Johnny banged
away an immense quantity of ammunition, much of it under the personal
supervision of Danny Randall. The latter had his own ideas as to the proper
practice. He utterly refused to let Johnny shoot at a small mark or linger on
his aim.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only fairly accurate work you want, but quick,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;If you practise always getting hold of your revolver the same way,
and squeeze the trigger instead of jerking it, you&#8217;ll do. If you run
against robbers it isn&#8217;t going to be any target match.&#8221;</p>

<p>When my cradle was finished, I went prospecting with a pan; and since this
was that golden year 1849, and the diggings were neither crowded nor worked out,
I soon found &#8216;colour.&#8217; There I dragged my cradle, and set quite happily to
work. Since I performed all my own labour, the process seemed slow to me after
the quick results of trained cooperation; <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_295'></a>295</span> yet my cleanings at night averaged more than my
share used to be under the partnership. So I fell into settled work, well
content. A week later Johnny rode up on a spirited and beautiful horse, proud as
could be over his mount.</p>

<p>He confided to me that it was one of the express horses; that the first trip
would be very soon; and that if I desired to send out my own savings, I could do
so. I was glad to do this, even though the rates were high; and we easily
persuaded Yank of the advisability. Nobody anticipated any danger from this
first trip, for the simple reason that few knew anything about it. Randall and
his friends made up the amount that could be carried by the three men. For the
first time I learned that Johnny had companions. They started from our own tent,
a little after sundown. Indeed, they ate their supper with us, while their
beautiful horses, head high, stared out into the growing darkness. One of the
express riders was a slight, dark youth whom I had never seen before. In the
other I was surprised to recognize Old Hickory Pine. He told me his people had
&#8220;squatted&#8221; not far from Sacramento, but that he had come up into the
hills on summons by Danny Randall. The fact impressed me anew as to
Randall&#8217;s wide knowledge, for the Pines had not been long in the
country.</p>

<p>The trip went through without incident. Johnny returned four days later aglow
with the joy of that adventurous ride through the dark. Robbers aside, I
acknowledge I should not have liked that job. I am no horseman, and I confess
that at full speed I am always uneasy as to how a four-hoofed animal is going
successfully to plant all <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_296'></a>296</span> four of them. And these three boys, for they were
nothing else, had to gallop the thirty miles of the road to Sacramento that lay
in the mountains before dawn caught them in the defiles.</p>

<p>Johnny seemed to glory in it, however. Danny Randall had arranged for a
change of horses; and the three express riders liked to dash up at full speed to
the relay station, fling themselves and their treasure bags from one beast to
the other, and be off again with the least possible expenditure of time. The
incoming animal had hardly come to a stand before the fresh animal was off.
There could have been no real occasion for quite so much haste; but they liked
to do it. The trips were made at irregular intervals; and the riders left camp
at odd times. Indeed, no hour of the twenty-four was unlikely to be that of
their start. Each boy carried fifty pounds of gold dust distributed in four
pouches. This was a heavy weight, but it was compensated for to some extent by
the fact that they rode very light saddles. Thus every trip the enormous sum of
thirty-five thousand dollars went out in charge of the three.</p>

<p>The first half dozen journeys were more or less secret, so that the express
service did not become known to the general public. Then the news inevitably
leaked out. Danny Randall thereupon openly received shipments and gave receipts
at the Bella Union. It seemed to me only a matter of time before the express
messengers should be waylaid, for the treasure they carried was worth any
one&#8217;s while. I spoke to Randall about it one day.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Amijo or Murietta or Dick Temple were in this <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span> part of the country, I&#8217;d agree
with you,&#8221; said he seriously, &#8220;but they are not, and there&#8217;s
nobody in this lot of cheap desperadoes around here that has the nerve. Those
three boys have a big reputation as fighters; their horses are good; they
constantly vary their route and their times of starting; and Johnny in especial
has a foxy head on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The weak point is the place they change horses,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Randall looked at me quickly, as though surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s true,&#8221; said he; &#8220;not a doubt of it. But
I&#8217;ve got five armed men there to look after just that. And another thing
you must remember: they know that Danny Randall is running this show.&#8221;</p>

<p>Certainly, thought I, Danny at least appreciates himself; and yet, after all,
I do not think he in any way exaggerated the terror his name inspired.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span><a id='link_32'></a>CHAPTER XXXII<br /><span class='h2fs'>ITALIAN BAR</span></h2>

<p>As now we are all settled down to our various occupations, Yank of patience,
Johnny of delighted adventuring, and myself of dogged industry, it might be well
to give you some sort of a notion of Italian Bar, as this new camp was called. I
saw a great deal of it, more than I really wished, for out of working hours I
much frequented it in the vague hope of keeping tabs on its activities for
Johnny&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>It was situated on one of the main overland trails, and that was possibly the
only reason its rich diggings had not been sooner discovered&#8211;it was too
accessible! The hordes of immigrants dragged through the dusty main street,
sometimes in an almost unending procession. More of them hereafter; they were in
general a sad lot. Some of them were always encamped in the flats below town;
and about one of the stores a number of them could be seen trying to screw their
resolution up to paying the appalling prices for necessities. The majority had
no spare money, and rarely any spirit left; and nobody paid much attention to
them except to play practical jokes on them. Very few if any of this influx
stopped at Italian Bar. Again it was too accessible. They had their vision fixed
hypnotically on the West, and westward they would push until they bumped the
Pacific Ocean. Of course a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_299'></a>299</span> great many were no such dumb creatures, but were
capable, self-reliant men who knew what they were about and where they were
going. Nobody tried to play any practical jokes on them.</p>

<p>Of the regular population I suppose three fourths were engaged in gold
washing. The miners did not differ from those of their class anywhere else; that
is to say, they were of all nationalities, all classes of life, and all degrees
of moral responsibility. They worked doggedly and fast in order to get as much
done as possible before the seasonal rains. When night fell the most of them
returned to their cabins and slept the sleep of the weary; with a weekly foray
into town of a more or less lurid character. They had no time for much else, in
their notion; and on that account were, probably unconsciously, the most selfish
community I ever saw. There was a great deal of sickness, and many deaths, but
unless a man had a partner or a friend to give him some care, he might die in
his cabin for all the attention any one else would pay him. In the same spirit
only direct personal interest would arouse in any of them the least indignation
over the only too frequent killings and robberies.</p>

<p>&#8220;They found a man shot by the Upper Bend this morning,&#8221; remarks
one to his neighbour.</p>

<p>&#8220;That so? Who was he?&#8221; asks the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. Didn&#8217;t hear,&#8221; is the reply.</p>

<p>The barroom or street killings, which averaged in number at least two or
three a week, while furnishing more excitement, aroused very little more real
interest. Open and above-board homicides of that sort were always the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span> result of differences of
opinion. If the victim had a friend, the latter might go gunning for his
pal&#8217;s slayer; but nobody had enough personal friends to elevate any such
row to the proportions of a general feud.</p>

<p>All inquests were set aside until Sunday. A rough and ready public meeting
invariably brought in the same verdict&#8211;&#8220;justifiable
self-defence.&#8221; At these times, too, popular justice was dispensed, but
carelessly and not at all in the spirit of the court presided over by John
Semple at Hangman&#8217;s Gulch. A general air of levity characterized these
occasions, which might strike as swift and deadly a blow as a shaft of
lightning, or might puff away as harmlessly as a summer zephyr. Many a time,
until I learned philosophically to stay away, did my blood boil over the
haphazard way these men had of disposing of some poor creature&#8217;s
destinies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a Mex thief,&#8221; observed the chair. &#8220;What do
you want done with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Move we cut off his ears!&#8221; yelled a voice from the back of the
crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it fifty lashes!&#8221; shouted another.</p>

<p>A wrangle at once started between the advocates of cropping and the whip. The
crowd wearied of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let the &#x2500; &#x2500; &#x2500; go!&#8221; suggested someone.</p>

<p>And this motion was carried with acclamation. No evidence was offered or
asked as to the extent of the man&#8217;s guilt, or indeed if he was guilty at
all!</p>

<p>The meeting had a grim sense of humour, and enjoyed nothing more than really
elaborate foolery. Such as, for example, the celebrated case of Pio
Chino&#8217;s bronco.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>Pio Chino was a
<i>cargador</i> running a train of pack-mules into some back-country camp. His
bell mare was an ancient white animal with long shaggy hair, ewe neck, bulging
joints, a placid wall eye, the full complement of ribs, and an extraordinarily
long Roman nose ending in a pendulous lip. Yet fifteen besotted mules thought
her beautiful, and followed her slavishly, in which fact lay her only value. Now
somebody, probably for a joke, &#8220;lifted&#8221; this ancient wreck from poor
Chino on the ground that it had never been Chino&#8217;s property anyway. Chino,
with childlike faith in the dignity of institutions, brought the matter before
the weekly court.</p>

<p>That body took charge with immense satisfaction. It appointed lawyers for the
prosecution and the defence.</p>

<p>Prosecution started to submit Chino&#8217;s claim.</p>

<p>Defence immediately objected on the ground that Chino, being a person of
colour, was not qualified to testify against a white man.</p>

<p>This point was wrangled over with great relish for an hour or more. Then two
solemn individuals were introduced as experts to decide whether Chino was a man
of colour, or, as the prosecution passionately maintained, a noble, great-minded
and patriotic California member of the Caucasian race.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; the court addressed this pair, &#8220;is there any
infallible method by which your science is able to distinguish between a nigger
and a white man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; answered one of the &#8220;experts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The back teeth of a white man have small roots reaching <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span> straight down,&#8221;
expounded the &#8220;expert&#8221; solemnly, &#8220;while those of a negro have
roots branching in every direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you expect to determine this case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By extracting one or more of the party&#8217;s back teeth,&#8221;
announced the &#8220;expert&#8221; gravely, at the same time producing a huge
pair of horseshoeing nippers.</p>

<p>Chino uttered a howl, but was violently restrained from bolting. He was
understood to say that he didn&#8217;t want that mare. I should not have been a
bit surprised if they had carried the idea of extraction to a finish; but the
counsel for defence interposed, waiving the point. He did not want the fun to
come to that sort of a termination.</p>

<p>Prosecution then offered the evidence of Chino&#8217;s brand. Now that old
mare was branded from muzzle to tail, and on both sides. She must have been sold
and resold four or five times for every year of her long and useful life. The
network of brands was absolutely indecipherable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shave her!&#8221; yelled some genius.</p>

<p>That idea caught hold. The entire gathering took an interest in the
operation, which half a dozen men performed. They shaved that poor old mare from
nose to the tip of her ratlike tail. Not even an eye-winker was left to her. She
resembled nothing so much as one of the sluglike little Mexican hairless dogs we
had seen on the Isthmus. The brands now showed plainly enough, but were as
complicated as ever in appearance. Thunders of mock forensic oratory shook the
air. I remember defence acknowledged that in that multiplicity of lines the
figure of Chino&#8217;s brand could be traced; but pointed to the stars of the
heavens and the figures of their constellations to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span> prove what could be done by a vivid
imagination in evolving fancy patterns. By this time it was late, and court was
adjourned until next week.</p>

<p>The following Sunday, after a tremendous legal battle, conducted with the
relishing solemnity with which Americans like to take their fooling, it was
decided to call in an expert on brands, and a certain California rancher ten
miles distant was agreed upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected the defence, &#8220;he is a countryman of the
complainant. However honest, he will nevertheless sympathize with his own blood.
Before the case is put before him, he should view these brands as an
unprejudiced observer. I suggest that they be transcribed to paper and submitted
to him without explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>This appealed to the crowd. The astonished mare was again led out, and
careful drawings made of her most remarkable sides. Then the case was again
adjourned one week.</p>

<p>On that day the Californian was on hand, very grave, very much dressed up,
very flattered at being called as an expert in anything. The drawing was laid
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don Luis,&#8221; said the court formally, &#8220;what do you, as
expert, make of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Don Luis bent his grave Spanish head over the document for some minutes. Then
he turned it upside down and examined it again; sideways; the other end. When he
looked up a little twinkle of humour lurked deep in his black eyes, but his face
was solemn and ceremonious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Don Luis,&#8221; repeated the court, &#8220;what do you make of
it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_304'></a>304</span>&#8220;Señor,&#8221; replied Don Luis courteously,
&#8220;it looks to me like a most excellent map of Sonora.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the crowd had quieted down after this, the court ordered the animal
brought forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;May it please y&#8217;r honour, the critter got a chill and done
died,&#8221; announced the cadaverous Missourian, to whose care the animal had
been confided.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said the court. &#8220;Well, here&#8217;s the
court&#8217;s decision in this case. Pio Chino fined one drink for taking up our
valuable time; Abe Sellers fined one drink for claiming such an old crow-bait on
any grounds; Sam is fined one drink for not putting a blanket on that
mare.&#8221; (&#8220;I only got one blanket myself!&#8221; cried the grieved
Missourian.) &#8220;The fines must be paid in to the court at the close of this
session.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hugely tickled, the meeting arose. Pio Chino, to whom the tidings of his bell
mare&#8217;s demise was evidently news, stood the picture of dejected woe. His
downcast figure attracted the careless attention of one of the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here boys!&#8221; he yelled, snatching off his hat. &#8220;This
ain&#8217;t so damn funny for Chino here!&#8221; He passed the hat among the
crowd. They tossed in gold, good-naturedly, abundantly, with a laugh. Nobody
knows what amount was dumped into the astounded Chino&#8217;s old sombrero; but
the mare was certainly not worth over fifteen dollars. If some one had dragged
Chino before that same gathering under unsupported accusation of any sort, it
would as cheerfully and thoughtlessly have hung him.</p>

<p>Of the gambling places, one only&#8211;that conducted by Danny Randall and
called the Bella Union&#8211;inspired any <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_305'></a>305</span> sort of confidence. The other two were frequented
by a rough, insolent crew, given to sudden silences in presence of newcomers,
good-humoured after a wild and disconcerting fashion, plunging heavily at the
gaming tables and drinking as heavily at the bars. This is not to imply that any
strong line of demarcation existed between the habitues of one or the other of
these places. When an inhabitant of Italian Bar started out for relaxation, he
visited everything there was to visit, and drifted impartially between
Morton&#8217;s, Randall&#8217;s Bella Union, and the Empire. There was a good
deal of noise and loud talk in any of them; and occasionally a pistol shot. This
was generally a signal for most of the bystanders to break out through the doors
and windows, and for the gayly inclined to shoot out the lights. The latter feat
has often been cited admiringly as testifying to a high degree of marksmanship,
but as a matter of fact the wind and concussion from the heavy revolver bullets
were quite sufficient to put out any lamp to which the missiles passed
reasonably close. Sometimes these affrays resulted in material for the Sunday
inquests; but it is astonishing how easily men can miss each other at close
range. Most of the shootings were the results of drunken quarrels. For that
reason the professed gunmen were rarely involved. One who possessed an
established reputation was let alone by the ordinary citizen; and most severely
alone by the swaggering bullies, of whom there were not a few. These latter
found prey for their queer stripe of vanity among the young, the weak, and the
drunken. I do not hesitate to say that any man of determined character could
keep out of trouble even in the worst days of the camp, provided <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306'></a>306</span> he had no tempting
wealth, attended to his own affairs, and maintained a quiet though resolute
demeanour.</p>

<p>When in camp Johnny and his two companions shone as bright particular stars.
They were only boys, and they had blossomed out in wonderful garments. Johnny
had a Californian sombrero with steeple crown loaded with silver ornaments, and
a pair of Spanish spurs heavily inlaid with the same metal, a Chinese scarf
about his neck, and a short jacket embroidered with silver thread. But most
astonishing of all was a large off-colour diamond set in a ring, through which
he ran the ends of his scarf. Parenthetically, it was from this that he got his
sobriquet of Diamond Jack. I had a good deal of fun laughing at Johnny, but he
didn&#8217;t mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;This diamond,&#8221; he pointed out, &#8220;is just as good as gold
dust, it&#8217;s easier carried, and I can have some fun out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am afraid he and Old Hickory Pine and Cal Marsh did a bit of swaggering
while in town. They took a day to the down trip, and jogged back in a day and a
half, stopping in Sacramento only the extra half day. Then they rested with us
one day, and were off the next. Thus they accomplished seven or eight trips in
the month. Both Old and Cal had the reputation of being quick, accurate shots,
although I have never seen them perform. As the three of them were absolutely
inseparable they made a formidable combination that nothing but an organized
gang would care to tackle. Consequently they swaggered as much as they pleased.
At bottom they were good, clean, attractive boys, who were engaged in an
adventure that was thrilling <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_307'></a>307</span> enough in sober reality, but which they loved to
deck forth in further romance. They one and all assumed the stern, aloof, lofty
pose of those whose affairs were too weighty to permit mingling with ordinary
amusements. Their speech was laconic, their manners grave, their attitude
self-contained. It was a good thing, I believe; for outside the fact that it
kept them out of quarrels, it kept them also out of drinking and gambling.</p>

<p>I made many acquaintances of course, but only a few friends. The best of
these were Dr. Rankin and Danny Randall. Strangely enough, these two were great
pals. Danny had a little room back of the Bella Union furnished out with a round
table, a dozen chairs, and a sofa. Here he loved to retire with his personal
friends to sip drinks, smoke, and to discuss all sorts of matters. A little
glassless window gave into the Bella Union, and as the floor of the little room
was raised a foot or so, Danny sat where he could see everything that went on.
These gatherings varied in number, but never exceeded the capacity of the dozen
chairs. I do not know how Danny had caused it to be understood that these were
invitation affairs, but understood it was, and no one ever presumed to intrude
unbidden into the little room. Danny selected his company as the fancy took
him.</p>

<p>As to why he should so often have chosen me I must again confess ignorance.
Perhaps because I was a good listener. If so, the third member of a very
frequent triumvirate, Dr. Rankin, was invited for the opposite quality. The
doctor was a great talker, an analyst of conditions, and a philosophical
spectator. The most <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_308'></a>308</span> frequent theme of our talks was the prevalence of
disorder. On this subject the doctor had very decided views.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is disorder because we shirk our duty as a community,&#8221; he
stated, &#8220;and we shirk our duty as a community because we believe in our
hearts that we aren&#8217;t a community. What does Jones or Smith or Robinson or
anybody else really care for Italian Bar as a place; or, indeed, for California
as a place? Not a tinker&#8217;s damn! He came out here in the first place to
make his pile, and in the second place to have a good time. He isn&#8217;t
dependent on any one&#8217;s good opinion, as he used to be at home. He refuses
to be bothered with responsibilities and he doesn&#8217;t need to be. Why a pan
miner needn&#8217;t even speak to his next neighbour unless he wants to; and a
cradle miner need bother only with his partners!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miners&#8217; meetings have done some pretty good legislation,&#8221;
I pointed out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Legislation; yes!&#8221; cried the doctor. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you
discovered that the American has a perfect genius for organization? Eight coal
heavers on a desert island would in a week have a full list of officers, a code
of laws, and would be wrangling over ridiculous parliamentary points of order in
their meetings. That&#8217;s just the trouble. The ease with which Americans can
sketch out a state on paper is an anodyne to conscience. We get together and
pass a lot of resolutions, and go away with a satisfied feeling that we&#8217;ve
really done something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I believe a camp like this may prove permanent,&#8221; objected
Randall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. And by that very fact a social obligation <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309'></a>309</span> comes into existence.
Trouble is, every mother&#8217;s son tries to escape it in his own case. What is
every one&#8217;s business is no one&#8217;s business. Every fellow thinks
he&#8217;s got away from being bothered with such things. Sooner or later
he&#8217;ll find out he hasn&#8217;t, and then he&#8217;ll have to pay for his
vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never stood for much thieving at Hangman&#8217;s Gulch,&#8221; I
interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We whipped and sent them about their business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To some other camp. You merely passed on your responsibility; you
didn&#8217;t settle it. Your whipping merely meant turning loose a revengeful
and desperate man. Your various banishments merely meant your exchanging these
fiends with the other camps. It&#8217;s like scattering the coyotes that come
around your fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you do, Doctor?&#8221; asked Randall quietly; &#8220;we
have no regular law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Why don&#8217;t you adopt a little regular law? You need
about three in this camp&#8211;against killing, against thievery, and against
assault. Only enforce in every instance, as far as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get this crowd to take time investigating the troubles
of some man they never heard of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if they get too bad,&#8221; said Danny, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to
get the stranglers busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound it, man!&#8221; roared Dr. Rankin, beating the table,
&#8220;that&#8217;s just what I&#8217;ve been trying to tell you. You ought not
to care so much for punishing as for deterring. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_310'></a>310</span> Don&#8217;t you know that it&#8217;s a commonplace
that it isn&#8217;t the terrifying quality of the penalty that acts as a
deterrent to crime, but it&#8217;s the certainty of the penalty! If a horse
thief knows that there&#8217;s merely a chance the community will get mad enough
to hang him, he&#8217;ll take that chance in hopes this may not be the time. If,
on the other hand, he knows that <i>every time</i> he steals a horse he&#8217;s
going to be caught and fined even, he thinks a long time before he steals
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All that&#8217;s true, Doctor,&#8221; said Danny, &#8220;as theory;
but now I&#8217;m coming to bat with a little practice. Here&#8217;s the camp of
Italian Bar in the year 1849. What would you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elect the proper officers and enforce the law,&#8221; answered the
doctor promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would you elect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are plenty of good men here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name me any one who would take the job. The good men are all washing
gold; and they&#8217;re in a hurry to finish before the rains. I don&#8217;t
care who you&#8217;re about to name&#8211;if anybody; this is about what
he&#8217;d say: &#8216;I can&#8217;t afford to leave my claim; I didn&#8217;t come out
here to risk my life in that sort of a row; I am leaving for the city when the
rains begin, and I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ll come back to Italian Bar
next season!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it worth their while. Pay them,&#8221; insisted the doctor
stoutly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how&#8217;s the money to pay them to be collected? You&#8217;d
have to create the officers of a government&#8211;and pay
<i>them</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311'></a>311</span>&#8220;Well, why
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the election, who would take interest to elect a decent man, even
if you could get hold of one? Not the other decent men. They&#8217;re too busy,
and too little interested. But the desperadoes and hard characters would be very
much interested in getting some of their own stripe in office. The chances are
they would be coming back to Italian Bar next season, especially if they had the
legal machinery for keeping themselves out of trouble. You&#8217;d simply put
yourself in their power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Rankin shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same, you&#8217;ll see that I am right,&#8221; he prophesied.
&#8220;This illusion of freedom to the social obligation is only an illusion. It
will have to be paid for with added violence and turmoil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I believe you&#8217;re right as to that, Doctor,&#8221; agreed
Danny, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve discovered that often in this world a man has to
pay a high price for what he gets. In fact, sometimes it&#8217;s very expedient
to pay a high price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can foresee a lot of violence before the thing is worked
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point the doctor, to his manifest disgust, was summoned to attend to
some patient.</p>

<p>&#8220;That all sounds interesting,&#8221; said I to Danny Randall once we
were alone, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t exactly fit it in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means,&#8221; said Danny, &#8220;that some day Morton&#8217;s gang
will go a little too far, and we&#8217;ll have to get together and string some
of them up.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312'></a>312</span><a id='link_33'></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE OVERLAND IMMIGRANTS</span></h2>

<p>The overland immigrants never ceased to interest us. The illness,
destitution, and suffering that obtained among these people has never been
adequately depicted. For one outfit with healthy looking members and adequate
cattle there were dozens conducted by hollow-eyed, gaunt men, drawn by few weak
animals. Women trudged wearily, carrying children. And the tales they brought
were terrible. They told us of thousands they had left behind in the great
desert of the Humboldt Sink, fighting starvation, disease, and the loss of
cattle. Women who had lost their husbands from the deadly cholera were
staggering on without food or water, leading their children. The trail was lined
with dead mules and cattle. Some said that five thousand had perished on the
plains from cholera alone. In the middle of the desert, miles from anywhere,
were the death camps, the wagons drawn in the usual circle, the dead animals
tainting the air, every living human being crippled from scurvy and other
diseases. There was no fodder for the cattle, and one man told us that he
estimated, soberly, that three fourths of the draught animals on the plains must
die.</p>

<p>&#8220;And then where will their owners be?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indians were hostile and thieving. Most of the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_313'></a>313</span> ample provision that had been laid in
had to be thrown away to lighten the loads for the enfeebled animals. Such
immigrants as got through often arrived in an impoverished condition. Many of
these on the route were reduced by starvation to living on the putrefied flesh
of the dead animals along the road. This occasioned more sickness. The desert
seemed interminable. At nightfall the struggling trains lay down exhausted with
only the assurance of another scorching, burning day to follow. And when at last
a few reached the Humboldt River, they found it almost impossible to
ford&#8211;and the feed on the other side. In the distance showed the high
forbidding ramparts of the Sierra Nevadas. A man named Delano told us that five
men drowned themselves in the Humboldt River in one day out of sheer
discouragement. Another man said he had saved the lives of his oxen by giving
some Indians fifteen dollars to swim the river and float some grass across to
him. The water of the Humboldt had a bad effect on horses, and great numbers
died. The Indians stole others. The animals that remained were weak. The
destruction of property was immense, for everything that could be spared was
thrown away in order to lighten the loads. The road was lined with abandoned
wagons, stoves, mining implements, clothes.</p>

<p>We were told these things over and over, heavily, in little snatches, by men
too wearied and discouraged and beaten even to rejoice that they had come
through alive. They were not interested in telling us, but they told, as though
their minds were so full that they could not help it. I remember one evening
when we were feeding at <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_314'></a>314</span> our camp the members of one of these trains, a
charity every miner proffered nearly every day of the week. The party consisted
of one wagon, a half dozen gaunt, dull-eyed oxen, two men, and a
crushed-looking, tragic young woman. One of the men had in a crude way the gift
of words.</p>

<p>He told of the crowds of people awaiting the new grass at Independence in
Missouri, of the making up of the parties, the election of officers for the
trip, the discussion of routes, the visiting, the campfires, the boundless
hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were near twenty thousand people waiting for the grass,&#8221;
said our friend; a statement we thought exaggerated, but one which I have
subsequently found to be not far from the truth.</p>

<p>By the middle of May the trail from the Missouri River to Fort Laramie was
occupied by a continuous line of wagons.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was fine travelling,&#8221; said the immigrant in the detached
way of one who speaks of dead history. &#8220;There was grass and water; and the
wagon seemed like a little house at night. Everybody was jolly. It didn&#8217;t
last long.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Fort Laramie there were three hundred miles of plains, with little
grass and less water.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought that was a desert!&#8221; exclaimed the immigrant bitterly.
&#8220;My God! Quite a lot turned back at Laramie. They were scared by the
cholera that broke out, scared by the stories of the desert, scared by the
Indians. They went back. I suppose they&#8217;re well and hearty&#8211;and
kicking themselves every gold report that goes back east.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315'></a>315</span>The bright
anticipations, the joy of the life, the romance of the journey all faded before
the grim reality. The monotony of the plains, the barrenness of the desert, the
toil of the mountains, the terrible heat, the dust, the rains, the sickness, the
tragedy of deaths had flattened all buoyancy, and left in its stead only a
sullen, dogged determination.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was lots of quarrelling, of course,&#8221; said our narrator.
&#8220;Everybody was on edge. There were fights, that we had to settle somehow,
and bad feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had several minor skirmishes with Indians, lost from their party by
disease, suffered considerable hardships and infinite toil.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought we&#8217;d had a hard time,&#8221; said our friend
wonderingly. &#8220;Lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the very start of the journey they had begun to realize that they were
overloaded, and had commenced to throw away superfluous goods. Several units of
the party had even to abandon some of their wagons.</p>

<p>&#8220;We chucked everything we thought we could get along without. I know we
spent all one day frying out bacon to get the grease before we threw it away. We
used the grease for our axles.&#8221;</p>

<p>They reached the head of the Humboldt. Until this point they had kept
together, but now demoralization began. They had been told at Salt Lake City
that they had but four hundred miles to go to Sacramento. Now they discovered
that at the Humboldt they had still more than that distance to travel; and that
before them lay the worst desert of all.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316'></a>316</span>&#8220;Mind
you,&#8221; said our friend, &#8220;we had been travelling desperately. Our
cattle had died one by one; and we had doubled up with our teams. We had starved
for water until our beasts were ready to drop and our own tongues had swollen in
our mouths, and were scared&#8211;<i>scared</i>, I tell
you&#8211;scared!&#8221;</p>

<p>He moistened his lips slowly, and went on. &#8220;Sometimes we took two or
three hours to go a mile, relaying back and forth. We were down to a fine point.
It wasn&#8217;t a question of keeping our property any more; it was a case of
saving our lives. We&#8217;d abandoned a good half of our wagons already. When
we got to the Humboldt and learned from a mountain man going the other way that
the great desert was still before us, and when we had made a day or two&#8217;s
journey down the river toward the Sink, I tell you we lost our nerve&#8211;and
our sense.&#8221; He ruminated a few moments in silence. &#8220;My God!
man!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;That trail! From about halfway down the river the
carcasses of horses and oxen were so thick that I believe if they&#8217;d been
laid in the road instead of alongside you could have walked the whole way
without setting foot to ground!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the river disappeared underground, and they had to face the crossing
of the Sink itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a real desert,&#8221; the immigrant told us sombrely.
&#8220;There were long white fields of alkali and drifts of ashes across them so
soft that the cattle sank way to their bellies. They moaned and bellowed! Lord,
how they moaned! And the dust rose up so thick you couldn&#8217;t breathe, and
the sun beat down so fierce you felt it like <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_317'></a>317</span> something heavy on your head. And how the place
stunk with the dead beasts!&#8221;</p>

<p>The party&#8217;s organization broke. The march became a rout. Everybody
pushed on with what strength he had. No man, woman, or child could ride; the
wagons were emptied of everything but the barest necessities. At every stop some
animal fell in the traces, and was cut out of the yoke. When a wagon came to a
stop, it was abandoned, the animals detached and driven forward.</p>

<p>Those who were still afoot were constantly besought by those who had been
forced to a standstill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw one old man, his wife and his daughter, all walking along on
foot,&#8221; said the immigrant bitterly. &#8220;They were half knee deep in
alkali, the sun was broiling hot, they had absolutely nothing. We couldn&#8217;t
help them. What earthly chance had they? I saw a wagon stalled, the animals
lying dead in their yokes, all except one old ox. A woman and three children sat
inside the wagon. She called to me that they hadn&#8217;t had anything to eat
for three days, and begged me to take the children. I couldn&#8217;t. I could
have stopped and died there with her, but I couldn&#8217;t put another pound on
my wagon and hope to get through. We were all walking alongside; even Sue,
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman raised her tragic face.</p>

<p>&#8220;We left our baby there,&#8221; she said; and stared back again into
the coals of the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;We made it,&#8221; resumed the immigrant. &#8220;We got to the Truckee
River somehow, and we rested there three days. I don&#8217;t know what became of
the rest of our train; dead perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318'></a>318</span>We told him of
the immigrant register or bulletin board at Morton&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must look that over,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how
long it took us to cross the mountains. Those roads are terrible; and our cattle
were weak. We were pretty near out of grub too. Most of the people have no food
at all. Well, here we are! But there are thousands back of us. What are they
going to do? And when the mountains fill with snow&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>After the trio, well fed for the first time in months, had turned in, we sat
talking about our fire. We were considerably subdued and sobered; for this was
the first coherent account we had heard at first hand. Two things impressed
us&#8211;the tragedy, the futility. The former aspect hit us all; the latter
struck strongly at Old and Cal. Those youngsters, wise in the ways of the
plains, were filled with sad surprise over the incompetence of it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;But thar ain&#8217;t no manner of <i>use</i> in it!&#8221; cried Old.
&#8220;They are just bullin&#8217; at it plumb regardless! They ain&#8217;t
handled their cattle right! They ain&#8217;t picked their route right&#8211;why,
the old Mormon trail down by the Carson Sink is better&#8217;n that death-trap across
the Humboldt. And cut-offs! What license they all got chasin&#8217; every fool
cut-off reported in? Most of &#8217;em is all right fer pack-trains and all
wrong fer wagons! Oh, Lord!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said I, &#8220;poor devils, they
don&#8217;t know. They were raised on farms and in the cities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny had said nothing. His handsome face looked very sombre in the
firelight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said he, &#8220;we&#8217;re due for a trip to-night; but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319'></a>319</span> want you to
promise me one thing&#8211;just keep these people here, and feed them up until
we get back. Tell them I&#8217;ve got a job for them. Will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to pump Johnny as to his intentions, but could get nothing out of
him; and so promised blindly. About two o&#8217;clock I was roused from my sleep
by a soft moving about. Thrusting my head from the tent I made out the dim
figures of our horsemen, mounted, and moving quietly away down the trail.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320'></a>320</span><a id='link_34'></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE PRISONERS</span></h2>

<p>I had no great difficulty in persuading the immigrants to rest over.</p>

<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth,&#8221; the narrator confided to me, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re going. We have no money, We&#8217;ve got to
get work somehow. I don&#8217;t know now why we came.&#8221;</p>

<p>His name, he told me, was George Woodruff; he had been a lawyer in a small
Pennsylvania town; his total possessions were now represented by the remains of
his ox team, his wagon, and the blankets in which he slept. The other man was
his brother Albert, and the woman his sister-in-law.</p>

<p>&#8220;We started with four wagons and a fine fit-out of supplies,&#8221; he
told me&#8211;&#8220;food enough to last two years. This is what we have left.
The cattle aren&#8217;t in bad shape now though; and they are extra fine stock.
Perhaps I can sell them for a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days passed. We arose the morning of the third to find that the oxen had
strayed away during the night. Deciding they could not have wandered far, I went
to my gold washing as usual, leaving Woodruff and his brother to hunt them up.
About ten o&#8217;clock they came to my claim very much troubled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321'></a>321</span>&#8220;We
can&#8217;t find them anywhere,&#8221; they told me, &#8220;and it doesn&#8217;t
seem natural that they should stray far; they are too tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knocked off work, and returned with them to the flat, where we proceeded to
look for tracks. The earth was too hard and tramped to show us much, and after a
half hour of fruitless examination we returned to camp with the intention of
eating something before starting out on a serious search. While thus engaged the
express messengers rode up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; said Johnny cheerfully. &#8220;Glad to hear you made
such a good thing out of your cattle!&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught our stare of surprise, swung from his horse and advanced on us with
three swift strides.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t sold them?&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking for them all the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stolen, boys!&#8221; he cried to his companions. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
our job! Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaped on his horse in the headlong, graceful fashion the boys had
cultivated at the relay station, and, followed by Cal and Old, dashed away.</p>

<p>We made nothing definite of this, though we had our surmises to exchange. As
the boys had not returned an hour later, I resumed my digging while the
Woodruffs went over to visit with Yank, who was now out of bed. Evening came,
with no sign of our friends. We turned in at last.</p>

<p>Some time after midnight we were awakened by the shuffling and lowing of
driven cattle, and went out into the moonlight to see our six oxen, just
released from herding, plunging their noses thirstily into the little stream
from the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322'></a>322</span> spring.
Five figures on horseback sat motionless in the background behind them. When the
cattle had finished drinking, the horsemen, riding in two couples and one
single, turned them into the flat, and then came over to our camp.</p>

<p>After they had approached within plain sight we saw that the single horseman
was Cal Marsh; and that Johnny and Old each led an animal on which a man was
tied, his arms behind him, his feet shackled beneath the horse&#8217;s
barrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you fellows,&#8221; said Johnny in a low voice, &#8220;just
catch hold here and help with these birds.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three descended rather wearily from their horses, the lead lines of which
Cal held while the rest unshackled the prisoners and helped them to dismount.
They were both known to me, one as the big desperado, Malone; and the other as
the barkeeper at Morton&#8217;s place, our old friend of Chagres days. The
latter&#8217;s head was roughly bound with a bloody cloth. Under Johnny&#8217;s
direction we tied them firmly. He issued his orders in a low-voiced, curt
fashion that precluded anything but the most instant and silent obedience.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said he at last, &#8220;they&#8217;ll do. Chuck them
inside where they&#8217;ll be out of sight. Now about those two
horses&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just run &#8217;em up to the Dutchman&#8217;s Flat and
stake &#8217;em out thar,&#8221; interposed Old. &#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t no one
thar; and they won&#8217;t be discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; conceded Johnny, &#8220;if your horse isn&#8217;t too
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll make it,&#8221; replied Old confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for our horses,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;Won&#8217;t do to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323'></a>323</span> getting in at this
time of night. It doesn&#8217;t look natural. Don&#8217;t believe we can get
them to the stable without being spotted. Maybe you&#8217;d better stake them up
there too. Can you walk back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; said Old.</p>

<p>He tied the four led horses together, mounted, took the lead rope from Cal,
and rode off up the gulch.</p>

<p>Cal came to the fire and sat down. I was instantly struck by his ghastly
appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cal&#8217;s bored through the shoulder,&#8221; Johnny explained.
&#8220;Now, Jim, you&#8217;ve got to go up and get Dr. Rankin. He lives at
Barnes&#8217;s hotel, you know. Barnes is all right; bring him down, too, if you
happen to wake him up. Go around to Danny Randall&#8217;s quietly and tell him
we want to see him. He sleeps in that little back room. Throw some pebbles
against the stovepipe; that&#8217;ll wake him up. Look out he doesn&#8217;t pot
you. Don&#8217;t let anybody see you if you can possibly help; and tell the
others to slip out here quietly, too. Do you understand all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what I&#8217;m to do,&#8221; I assented; &#8220;but let me in!
What&#8217;s it all about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We met these men and three others driving Woodruff&#8217;s oxen this
morning,&#8221; said Johnny rapidly. &#8220;Stopped and had quite a chat with
them. They told what sounded like a straight story of having bought the oxen. I
knew Woodruff wanted to sell. Didn&#8217;t suppose they&#8217;d have the nerve
to lift them right under our noses. Guess they hadn&#8217;t an idea they&#8217;d
meet us on the road. We were taking the lower trail just for a change. So as
soon as we got the news from you, we went back, of course. They <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324'></a>324</span> suspected trouble, and
had turned off. Old and Cal are wonders at trailing. Came up with them just
beyond Bitter Water, and monkeyed around quite a while before we got a
favourable chance to tackle them. Then we took the cattle away and brought back
these birds. That&#8217;s all there was to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said five. Where are the other three?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Killed &#8217;em,&#8221; said Johnny briefly. &#8220;Now run along and
do your job.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some delay and difficulty I fulfilled my instructions, returning at
last in company with Danny Randall, to find my friends sitting around the little
fire, and Dr. Rankin engaged in bathing Cal&#8217;s wound. Johnny was repeating
his story, to which the others were listening attentively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I learned a little more of this sort of thing in Sacramento,&#8221; he
was concluding. &#8220;And I&#8217;d like to state this right here and now:
practical jokes on these immigrants are poor taste as far as I am concerned from
now on. That&#8217;s my own private declaration of war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a look at your birds, Johnny,&#8221; suggested
Randall.</p>

<p>I brought out the prisoners and stacked them up against the trees. They gave
us back look for look defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t live a week after this,&#8221; said the Morton man,
whose name was Carhart, addressing Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just have a look at your head, my friend,&#8221; said Dr.
Rankin.</p>

<p>The man bent his head, and the doctor began to remove the bloody
bandages.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325'></a>325</span>&#8220;Question
is,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;what do we do with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Danny was thinking hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of two things,&#8221; said he at length: &#8220;We can string them
up quietly, and leave them as a warning; or we can force matters to a showdown
by calling a public meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Question is,&#8221; said I, &#8220;whether we can get anybody with
nerve enough to serve as officers of court, or, indeed, to testify as
witnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said a true word there,&#8221; put in Carhart with an oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bear witness for one,&#8221; offered Dr. Rankin, looking up
from his work, &#8220;and on a good many things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, damn you!&#8221; muttered Carhart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been called to a good many cases of gunshot wounds,&#8221;
continued the doctor steadily, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve kept quiet because I was
given to understand that my life was worth nothing if I spoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better keep your mouth shut!&#8221; warned the bandit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; pursued the doctor, &#8220;I personally believe the time
has come to assert ourselves. I&#8217;m in favour of serving notice on the whole
lot, and cleaning up the mess once and for all. I believe there are more decent
men than criminals in this camp, if you get them together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my idea,&#8221; agreed Johnny heartily. &#8220;Get the
camp together; I&#8217;ll see every man in it and let Woodruff tell his tale,
and then let Old or me tell ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll tell mine,&#8221; said Dr. Rankin.</p>

<p>Danny Randall shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll rise to it like men!&#8221; cried Johnny indignantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326'></a>326</span> &#8220;Nobody but
a murderer and cattle thief listening to that story could remain
unmoved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Danny, &#8220;if you won&#8217;t just quietly hang
these fellows right now, try the other. I should string &#8217;em up and shut
their mouths. You&#8217;re too early; it won&#8217;t do.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327'></a>327</span><a id='link_35'></a>CHAPTER XXXV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TRIAL</span></h2>

<p>The meeting took place in the Bella Union, and the place was crowded to the
doors. All the roughs in town were on hand, fully armed, swearing, swaggering,
and brandishing their weapons. They had much to say by way of threat, for they
did not hesitate to show their sympathies. As I looked upon their unexpected
numbers and listened to their wild talk, I must confess that my heart failed me.
Though they had not the advantage in numbers, they knew each other; were
prepared to work together; were, in general, desperately courageous and
reckless, and imbued with the greatest confidence. The decent miners, on the
other hand, were practically unknown to each other; and, while brave enough and
hardy enough, possessed neither the recklessness nor desperation of the others.
I think our main weakness sprang from the selfish detachment that had prevented
us from knowing whom to trust.</p>

<p>After preliminary organization a wrangle at once began as to the form of the
trial. We held very strongly that we should continue our usual custom of open
meeting; but Morton insisted with equal vehemence that the prisoners should have
jury trial. The discussion grew very hot and confused. Pistols and knives were
flourished. The chair <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_328'></a>328</span> put the matter to a vote, but was unable to decide
from the yells and howls that answered the question which side had the
preponderance. A rising vote was demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t they attempt a rescue?&#8221; I asked of Danny Randall,
under cover of the pandemonium. &#8220;They could easily fight their way
free.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would mean outlawing themselves. They would rather get clear
under some show of law. Then they figure to run the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>The vote was understood to favour a jury trial.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it,&#8221; said Danny; &#8220;the poor damn
fools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>In the selection of the jury we had the advantage. None of the roughs could
get on the panel to hang the verdict, for the simple reason that they were all
too well known. The miners cautiously refused to endorse any one whose general
respectability was not known to them. I found myself one of those selected.</p>

<p>A slight barrier consisting of a pole thrown across one corner of the room
set aside a jury box. We took our places therein. Men crowded to the pole,
talking for our benefit, cursing steadily, and uttering the most frightful
threats.</p>

<p>I am not going to describe that most turbulent afternoon. The details are
unessential to the main point, which was our decision. Counsel was appointed by
the court from among the numerous ex-lawyers. The man who took charge of the
defence was from New York, and had <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_329'></a>329</span> served some ten years in the profession before the
gold fever took him. I happen to know that he was a most sober-minded, steady
individual, not at all in sympathy with the rougher elements; but, like most of
his ilk, he speedily became so intensely interested in plying his profession
that he forgot utterly the justice of the case. He defended the lawless element
with all the tricks at his command. For that reason Woodruff was prevented from
testifying at all, except as to his ownership of the cattle; so that the effect
of his pathetic story was lost. Dr. Rankin had no chance to appear. This meeting
should have marked the awakening of public spirit to law and order; and if all
the elements of the case had been allowed to come before the decent part of the
community in a common-sense fashion, I am quite sure it would have done so. But
two lawyers got interested in tangling each other up with their technicalities,
and the result was that the real significance of the occasion was lost to sight.
The lawyer for the defence, pink and warm and happy, sat down quite pleased with
his adroitness. A few of us, and the desperadoes, alone realized what it all
meant.</p>

<p>We retired to Randall&#8217;s little room to deliberate. Not a man of the
twelve of us had the first doubt as to the guilt of the prisoners. We took a
ballot. The result was eleven for acquittal and one for conviction. I had cast
the one vote for conviction.</p>

<p>We argued the matter for three hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt the men are guilty,&#8221; said one.
&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the question. The question is, dare we declare
it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330'></a>330</span>&#8220;It
amounts to announcing our own death sentence,&#8221; argued another.
&#8220;Those fellows would stand together, but who of the lot would stand by us?
Why, we don&#8217;t even know for sure who would be with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This case ought never to have been tried by a jury,&#8221; complained
a third bitterly. &#8220;It ought to have been tried in a miners&#8217; court;
and if it hadn&#8217;t been for those soft heads who were strong for doing
things &#8216;regularly&#8217; instead of sensibly, we&#8217;d have had it done that
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said an older man gravely, &#8220;I agree to that. I am
going to be governed in my decision not by the merits of the case, but by the
fact that I have a family back in the States. I consider my obligations to them
greater than to this community.&#8221;</p>

<p>I reasoned with them for a long time, bringing to bear all the arguments I
had heard advanced at various times during our discussions in Danny
Randall&#8217;s back room. At last, seeing I could in no manner shake their
resolution, I gave in. After all, I could not blame them. The case was to them
only one of cattle stealing; they had no chance to realize that it was anything
more. Without solicitation on my part they agreed to keep secret my opposition
to the verdict of acquittal.</p>

<p>Our decision was greeted by wild yells and the discharge of pistols on the
part of the rough element. The meeting broke up informally and in confusion. It
would have been useless for the presiding officer to have attempted to dismiss
court. The mob broke through en masse to congratulate the prisoners. Immediately
the barkeepers were overwhelmed with work. Here and there I could see <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331'></a>331</span> a small group of the
honest men talking low-voiced, with many shakes of the head. Johnny, Old, and
Cal, who had attended with his arm slung up, had their heads together in a
corner. Danny Randall, who, it will be remembered, had not appeared publicly in
any way, stood at his customary corner of the bar watching all that was going
on. His gamblers were preparing to reopen the suspended games.</p>

<p>After conferring together a moment the three express messengers made their
way slowly across the room to the bar. I could not see exactly what happened,
but heard the sudden reverberations of several pistol shots. The lamps and
glasses rattled with the concussion, the white smoke of the discharges eddied
and rose. An immediate dead silence fell, except for the sounds made by the
movements of those seeking safe places. Johnny and his two friends shoulder to
shoulder backed slowly away toward the door. Johnny and Old presented each two
pistols at the group around the bar, while Cal, a revolver in his well hand,
swept the muzzle slowly from side to side. Nobody near the bar stirred. The
express messengers backed to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your heads inside,&#8221; warned Johnny clearly. On the words
they vanished.</p>

<p>Immediately pandemonium broke loose. The men along the bar immediately became
very warlike; but none of those who brandished pistols tried to leave the
building. From the swing and sway of the crowd, and the babel of yells, oaths,
threats, and explanations I could make nothing. Danny Randall alone of all those
in the room held his position <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_332'></a>332</span> unmoved. At last a clear way offered, so I went
over to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; I shouted at him through the din.</p>

<p>Danny shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;They killed Carhart and Malone,&#8221; Danny replied curtly.</p>

<p>It seemed, I ascertained at last, that the three had advanced and opened fire
on the two ex-prisoners without warning.</p>

<p>As soon as possible I made my escape and returned to our own camp. There I
found the three of them seated smoking, their horses all saddled, standing near
at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they coming our way?&#8221; asked Johnny instantly.</p>

<p>I told them that I had seen no indications of a mob.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you do it?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;It&#8217;s an open
challenge! They&#8217;ll get you boys now sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen,&#8221; said Johnny grimly. &#8220;But it was
the only thing to do. If Carhart and Malone had ever been given time to report
on our confab the other evening, you and Danny Randall and Dr. Rankin would have
been marked men. Now no one knows of your connection with this
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;ll be after you&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were after us in any case,&#8221; Johnny pointed out.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t deceive yourself there. Now you keep out of this and let us
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we can handle this bunch,&#8221; said Old.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord! what a lot of jellyfish!&#8221; cried Johnny disgustedly.
&#8220;Danny was right enough about them. But let me state right here and once
again that practical jokes on immigrants are going to be mighty unhealthy
here.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333'></a>333</span><a id='link_36'></a>CHAPTER XXXVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RULE OF THE LAWLESS</span></h2>

<p>No concerted attempt was made by the roughs to avenge the execution of their
comrades. Whether they realized that such an attempt would be likely to solidify
the decent element, or whether that sort of warfare was not their habit, the
afternoon and night wore away without trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger&#8217;s over,&#8221; announced Johnny the following
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What next?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go up to town,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>This they proceeded to do, negativing absolutely my desire to accompany
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay out of this,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;Go and wash gold as
usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was immensely relieved that afternoon when they returned safe and sound.
Afterward I heard that they had coolly visited every saloon and gambling place,
had stopped in each to chat with the barkeepers and gamblers, had spent the
morning seated outside the Bella Union, and had been in no manner molested.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be all right as long as they stick together and keep in
the open,&#8221; Yank assured me. &#8220;That gang will sooner assassinate than
fight.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334'></a>334</span>Although for the
moment held in check by the resolute front presented by these three boys, the
rough element showed that it considered it had won a great victory, and was now
entitled to run the town. Members of the gang selected what goods they needed at
any of the stores, making no pretence of payment. They swaggered boldly about
the streets at all times, infested the better places such as the Bella Union,
elbowed aside insolently any inoffensive citizen who might be in their way, and
generally conducted themselves as though they owned the place. Robberies grew
more frequent. The freighters were held up in broad daylight; rumours of
returning miners being relieved of their dust drifted up from the lower country;
mysterious disappearances increased in number. Hardly an attempt was made to
conceal the fact that the organized gang that conducted these operations had its
headquarters at Italian Bar. Strange men rode up in broad daylight, covered with
red dust, to confer with Morton or one of the other resident blackguards.
Mysteriously every desperado in the place began to lay fifty-dollar octagonal
slugs on the gaming tables, product of some lower country atrocity.</p>

<p>The camp soon had a concrete illustration of the opinion the roughs held of
themselves. It was reported quietly among a few of us that several of our number
had been &#8220;marked&#8221; by the desperadoes. Two of these were Joe
Thompson, who had acted as counsel for the prosecution in the late trial, and
Tom Cleveland, who had presided, and presided well, over the court. Thompson
kept one of the stores, while Cleveland was proprietor of the butcher shop. No
overt threats were made, but we understood that somehow <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_335'></a>335</span> these men were to be put out of the
way. Of course they were at once warned.</p>

<p>The human mind is certainly a queer piece of mechanism. It would seem that
the most natural thing to have done, in the circumstances, would have been to
dog these men&#8217;s footsteps until an opportunity offered to assassinate them
quietly. That is just what would have been done had the intended victims been
less prominently in the public eye. The murder of court officials, however, was
a very different matter from the finding of an unknown miner dead in his camp or
along the trail. In the former case there could be no manner of doubt as to the
perpetrators of the deed&#8211;the animus was too directly to be traced. And it
is a matter for curious remark that in all early history, whether of California
in the forties, or of Montana in the bloodier sixties, the desperadoes, no
matter how strong they felt themselves or how arrogantly they ran the community,
nevertheless must have felt a great uncertainty as to the actual power of the
decent element. This is evidenced by the fact that they never worked openly.
Though the identity of each of them as a robber and cut-throat was a matter of
common knowledge, so that any miner could have made out a list of the members of
any band, the fact was never formally admitted. And as long as it was not
admitted, and as long as actual hard proof was lacking, it seemed to be part of
the game that nothing could be done. Moral certainties did not count until some
series of outrages resulted in mob action.</p>

<p>Now consider this situation, which seemed to me then as it seems to me now,
most absurd in every way. Nobody <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_336'></a>336</span> else considered it so. Everybody knew that the
rough element was out to &#8220;get&#8221; Thompson and Cleveland. Everybody,
including both Thompson and Cleveland themselves, was pretty certain that they
would not be quietly assassinated, the argument in that case being that the deed
would be too apt to raise the community. Therefore it was pretty well understood
that some sort of a quarrel or personal encounter would be used as an excuse.
Personally I could not see that that would make much essential difference; but,
as I said, the human mind is a curious piece of mechanism.</p>

<p>Among the occasional visitors to the camp was a man who called himself Harry
Crawford. He was a man of perhaps twenty-five years, tall, rather slender, with
a clear face and laughing blue eyes. Nothing in his appearance indicated the
desperado; and yet we had long known him as one of the Morton gang. This man now
took up his residence in camp; and we soon discovered that he was evidently the
killer. The first afternoon he picked some sort of a petty quarrel with Thompson
over a purchase, but cooled down instantly when unexpectedly confronted by a
half dozen miners who came in at the opportune moment. A few days afterward in
the slack time of the afternoon Thompson, while drinking at the bar of the
Empire and conversing with a friend, was approached by a well-known sodden
hanger-on of the saloons.</p>

<p>&#8220;What &#8217;n hell you fellows talking about?&#8221; demanded this man
impudently.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of your business,&#8221; replied Thompson impatiently, for the
man was a public nuisance, and besides was deep in Thompson&#8217;s debt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337'></a>337</span>The man broke
into foul oaths.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll dare you to fight!&#8221; he cried in a furious
passion.</p>

<p>Facing about, Thompson saw Crawford standing attentively among the listeners,
and instantly comprehended the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the odds of me with a pistol,&#8221; said Thompson, who
notoriously had no skill with that weapon. &#8220;Why should I fight
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; cried the man, &#8220;put up your fists;
that&#8217;ll show who is the best man!&#8221;</p>

<p>He snatched off his belt and laid it on the bar. Thompson did the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; cried the challenger, backing away.</p>

<p>Thompson, thoroughly angry, reached over and slapped his antagonist. The
latter promptly drew another revolver from beneath his coat, but before he could
aim it Thompson jumped at his throat and disarmed him. At this moment Crawford
interfered, apparently as peacemaker. Thompson was later told secretly by the
barkeeper that the scheme was to lure him into a pistol fight in the street,
when Crawford would be ready to shoot him as soon as the first shot was
fired.</p>

<p>On the strength of his interference Crawford next pretended to friendship,
and spent much of his time at Thompson&#8217;s store. Thompson was in no way
deceived. This state of affairs continued for two days. It terminated in the
following manner: Crawford, sitting half on the counter, and talking with all
the great charm of which he was master, led the subject to weapons.</p>

<p>&#8220;This revolver of mine,&#8221; said he, at the same time drawing <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338'></a>338</span> the weapon from its
holster, &#8220;is one of the old navy model. You don&#8217;t often see them
nowadays. It has a double lock.&#8221; He cocked it as though to illustrate his
point, and the muzzle, as though by accident, swept toward the other man. He
looked up from his affected close examination to find that Thompson had also
drawn his weapon and that the barrel was pointing uncompromisingly in his
direction.</p>

<p>For a moment the two stared each other in the eye. Then Crawford sheathed his
pistol with an oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Thompson firmly, &#8220;that I do not intend you
shall get the advantage of me. You know my opinion of you and your gang. I shall
not be shot by any of you, if I can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Crawford withdrew quietly, but later in the day approached a big group of us,
one of which was Thompson.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a matter between you and me has got to be
settled!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can&#8217;t imagine what it is,&#8221; replied Thompson.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not aware that I&#8217;ve said or done anything to you that
needs settlement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t laugh!&#8221; replied Crawford, with a string of
insulting oaths. &#8220;You&#8217;re a coward; and if you&#8217;re anything of a
man you will step out of doors and have this out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, as you say, a coward,&#8221; replied Thompson quietly,
&#8220;and I see no reason for going out of doors to fight you or anybody
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>After blustering and swearing for a few moments Crawford withdrew. He made no
attempt to fight, nor do I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_339'></a>339</span> believe his outburst had any other purpose than to
establish the purely personal character of the quarrel between Thompson and
himself. At any rate, Thompson was next morning found murdered in his bunk,
while Crawford had disappeared. I do not know whether Crawford had killed him or
not; I think not.</p>

<p>About this time formal printed notices of some sort of election were posted
on the bulletin board at Morton&#8217;s place. At least they were said to have
been posted, and were pointed out to all comers the day after election. Perhaps
they were there all the time, as claimed, but nobody paid much attention to
them. At any rate, we one day awoke to the fact that we were a full-fledged
community, with regularly constituted court officers, duly qualified officials,
and a sheriff. The sheriff was Morton, and the most worthy judges were other
members of his gang!</p>

<p>This move tickled Danny Randall&#8217;s sense of humour immensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good head work,&#8221; he said approvingly. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t think Morton had it in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time something was done to run that gang out of
town,&#8221; fumed Dr. Rankin.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; it is not time,&#8221; denied Danny, &#8220;any more than it was
time when you and Johnny and the rest of you had your celebrated jury
trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to know what you are driving at!&#8221; fretted the
worthy doctor.</p>

<p>Danny Randall laughed in his gentle little fashion. I will confess that just
at that time I was very decidedly wondering what Danny Randall was at. In fact,
at <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340'></a>340</span> moments I was
strongly inclined to doubt his affiliations. He seemed to stand in an absolutely
neutral position, inclining to neither side.</p>

<p>Tom Cleveland was killed in the open street by one of the Empire hangers-on.
The man was promptly arrested by Morton in his capacity of sheriff, and confined
in chains. Morton, as sheriff, selected those who were to serve on the jury. I
had the curiosity to attend the trial, expecting to assist at an uproarious
farce. All the proceedings, on the contrary, were conducted with the greatest
decorum, and with minute attention to legal formalities. The assassin, however,
was acquitted.</p>

<p>From that time the outrages increased in number and in boldness. No man known
to be possessed of any quantity of gold was safe. It was dangerous to walk alone
after dark, to hunt alone in the mountains, to live alone. Every man carried his
treasure about with him everywhere he went. No man dared raise his voice in
criticism of the ruling powers, for it was pretty generally understood that such
criticism meant death.</p>

<p>It would be supposed, naturally, by you in our modern and civilized days,
that such a condition of affairs would cast a fear and gloom over the life of
the community. Not at all. Men worked and played and gambled and drank and joked
and carried on the light-hearted, jolly existence of the camps just about the
same as ever. Outside a few principals like Morton and his immediate satellites,
there was no accurate demarkation between the desperadoes and the miners.
Indeed, no one was ever quite sure of where his next neighbour&#8217;s
sympathies lay. We all mingled <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_341'></a>341</span> together, joked, had a good time&#8211;and were
exceedingly cautious. It was a polite community. Personal quarrels were the
product of the moment, and generally settled at the moment or soon after.
Enmities were matters for individual adjustment.</p>

<p>Randall&#8217;s express messengers continued to make their irregular trips
with the gold dust. They were never attacked, though they were convinced, and I
think justly, that on numerous occasions they had only just escaped attack.
Certainly the sums of money they carried were more than sufficient temptation to
the bandits. They knew their country, however, and were full of Indian-like
ruses, twists, doublings and turns which they employed with great gusto. How
long they would have succeeded in eluding what I considered the inevitable, I do
not know; but at this time occurred the events that I shall detail in the next
chapter.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342'></a>342</span><a id='link_37'></a>CHAPTER XXXVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE LAST STRAW</span></h2>

<p>This is a chapter I hate to write; and therefore I shall get it over with as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>Yank had progressed from his bunk to the bench outside, and from that to a
slow hobbling about near the Moreña cabin. Two of the three months demanded by
Dr. Rankin had passed. Yank&#8217;s leg had been taken from the splint, and, by
invoking the aid of stout canes, he succeeded in shifting around. But the trail
to town was as yet too rough for him. Therefore a number of us were in the habit
of spending our early evenings with him. We sat around the door, and smoked
innumerable pipes, and talked sixty to the minute. Moreña had a guitar to the
accompaniment of which he sang a number of plaintive and sweet-toned songs.
Three or four of his countrymen occasionally came up from below. Then they, too,
sang more plaintive songs; or played a strange game with especial cards which
none of us &#8220;gringos&#8221; could ever fathom; or perhaps stepped a grave,
formal sort of dance. Señora Moreña, the only woman, would sometimes join in
this. She was a large woman, but extraordinarily light on her feet. In fact, as
she swayed and balanced opposite her partner she reminded me of nothing so much
as a balloon tugging gently at its string.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343'></a>343</span>&#8220;But it
ees good, the dance, eh, señores?&#8221; she always ended, her broad, kind face
shining with pleasure.</p>

<p>We Americans reciprocated with a hoe-down or so, to jigging strains
blasphemously evoked by one of our number from that gentle guitar; and perhaps a
song or two. <i>Oh, Susannah!</i> was revived; and other old favourites; and we
had also the innumerable verses of a brand-new favourite, local to the country.
It had to do with the exploits and death of one Lame Jesse. I can recall only
two of the many verses:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;Lame Jesse was a hard old case;<br /> He never would repent.<br />
He ne&#8217;er was known to miss a meal&#8211;<br /> He never paid a cent!<br />
&#160;<br /> &#8220;Lame Jesse, too, like all the rest,<br /> He did to
Death resign;<br /> And in his bloom went up the flume<br /> In the days of
Forty-nine.&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>When the evening chill descended, which now was quite early, we scattered to
our various occupations, leaving Yank to his rest.</p>

<p>One Sunday in the middle of October two men trudged into town leading each a
pack-horse.</p>

<p>I was at the time talking to Barnes at his hotel, and saw them from a
distance hitching their animals outside Morton&#8217;s. They stayed there for
some time, then came out, unhitched their horses, led them as far as the Empire,
hesitated, finally again tied the beasts, and disappeared. In this manner they
gradually worked along to the Bella <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_344'></a>344</span> Union, where at last I recognized them as McNally
and Buck Barry, our comrades of the Porcupine. Of course I at once rushed over
to see them.</p>

<p>I found them surrounded by a crowd to whom they were offering drinks
free-handed. Both were already pretty drunk, but they knew me as soon as I
entered the door, and surged toward me hands out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! well! well!&#8221; cried McNally delightedly. &#8220;And
here&#8217;s himself! And who&#8217;d have thought of seeing you here! I made
sure you were in the valley and out of the country long since. And you&#8217;re
just in time! Make a name for it? Better call it whiskey straight. Drink to us,
my boy! Come, join my friends! We&#8217;re all friends here! Come on, and
here&#8217;s to luck, the best luck ever! We&#8217;ve got two horse-loads of
gold out there&#8211;nothing but gold&#8211;and it all came from our old
diggings. You ought to have stayed. We had no trouble. Bagsby was an old
fool!&#8221; All the time he was dragging me along by the arm toward the crowd
at the bar. Barry maintained an air of owlish gravity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Missouri Jones?&#8221; I inquired; but I might as well
have asked the stone mountains. McNally chattered on, excited, his blue eyes
dancing, bragging over and over about his two horse-loads of gold.</p>

<p>The crowd took his whiskey, laughed with him, and tried shrewdly to pump him
as to the location of his diggings. McNally gave them no satisfaction there; but
even when most hilarious retained enough sense to put them off the track.</p>

<p>As will be imagined, I was most uneasy about the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_345'></a>345</span> whole proceeding, and tried quietly to
draw the two men off.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; cried McNally, &#8220;not any! Jes&#8217; struck town,
and am goin&#8217; to have a <i>time</i>!&#8221; in which determination he was
cheered by all the bystanders. I did not know where to turn; Johnny was away on
one of his trips, and Danny Randall was not to be found. Finally inspiration
served me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down first and see Yank,&#8221; I urged. &#8220;Poor old Yank is
crippled and can&#8217;t move.&#8221;</p>

<p>That melted them at once. They untied their long-suffering animals, and we
staggered off down the trail.</p>

<p>On the way down I tried, but in vain, to arouse them to a sense of
danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve let everybody in town know you have a lot of dust,&#8221;
I pointed out.</p>

<p>McNally merely laughed recklessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boys!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t harm a fly!&#8221;
and I could veer him to no other point of view. Barry agreed to everything, very
solemn and very owlish.</p>

<p>We descended on Yank like a storm. I will say that McNally at any time was
irresistible and irrepressible, but especially so in his cups. We laughed
ourselves sick that afternoon. The Moreñas were enchanted. Under instructions,
and amply supplied with dust, Moreña went to town and returned with various
bottles. Señora Moreña cooked a fine supper. In the meantime, I, as apparently
the only responsible member of the party, unsaddled the animals, and brought
their burdens into the cabin. Although McNally&#8217;s statement as to the loads
consisting <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346'></a>346</span>
exclusively of gold was somewhat of an exaggeration, nevertheless the
<i>cantinas</i> were very heavy. Not knowing what else to do with them, I thrust
them under Yank&#8217;s bunk.</p>

<p>The evening was lively, I will confess it, and under the influence of it my
caution became hazy. Finally, when I at last made my way back to my own camp, I
found myself vastly surprised to discover Yank hobbling along by my side. I
don&#8217;t know why he came with me, and I do not think he knew either.
Probably force of habit. At any rate, we left the other four to sleep where they
would. I remember we had some difficulty in finding places to lie.</p>

<p>The sun was high when we awoke. We were not feeling very fresh, to say the
least; and we took some little time to get straightened around. Then we went
down to the Moreña cabin.</p>

<p>I am not going to dwell on what we found there. All four of its inmates had
been killed with buckshot, and the place ransacked from end to end. Apparently
the first volley had killed our former partners and Señora Moreña as they lay.
Moreña had staggered to his feet and halfway across the room.</p>

<p>The excitement caused by this frightful crime was intense. Every man quit
work. A great crowd assembled. Morton as sheriff was very busy, and loud threats
were uttered by his satellites as to the apprehension of the murderers. The
temper of the crowd, however, was sullen. No man dared trust his neighbour, and
yet every honest breast swelled with impotent indignation at this wholesale and
unprovoked massacre. No clue was possible. Everybody <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_347'></a>347</span> remembered, of course, how broadcast
and publicly the fact of the gold had been scattered. Nobody dared utter his
suspicions, if he had any.</p>

<p>The victims were buried by a large concourse, that eddied and hesitated and
muttered long after the graves had been filled in. Vaguely it was felt that the
condition of affairs was intolerable; but no one knew how it was to be remedied.
Nothing definite could be proved against any one, and yet I believe that every
honest man knew to a moral certainty at least the captains and instigators of
the various outrages. A leader could have raised an avenging mob&#8211;provided
he could have survived the necessary ten minutes!</p>

<p>We scattered at last to our various occupations. I was too much upset to
work, so I returned to where Yank was smoking over the fire. He had, as near as
I can remember, said not one word since the discovery of the tragedy. On my
approach he took his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing done?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;What is there to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said he, replacing his pipe; then around the
stem of it, &#8220;I was fond of those people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So was I,&#8221; I agreed sincerely. &#8220;Have you thought what a
lucky escape you yourself had?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yank nodded. We sat for a long time in silence. My thoughts turned slowly and
sullenly in a heavy, impotent anger. A small bird chirped plaintively from the
thicket near at hand. Except for the tinkle of our little stream and the muffled
roar of the distant river, this was the only sound to strike across the dead
black silence of the autumn night. So persistently did the bird utter its single
call <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348'></a>348</span> that at last
it aroused even my downcast attention, so that I remarked on it carelessly to
Yank. He came out of his brown study and raised his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no bird, it&#8217;s a human,&#8221; he said, after
listening a moment. &#8220;That&#8217;s a signal. Go see what it is. Just wander
out carelessly.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the depths of the thicket I found a human figure crouched. It glided to
me, and I made out dimly the squat form of Pete, Barnes&#8217;s negro slave,
from the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lo&#8217;<i>dee</i>, massa,&#8221; whispered he, &#8220;done thought
you nevah <i>would</i> come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Pete?&#8221; I asked in the same guarded tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;I done got somefin&#8217; to tell you. While I ketchin&#8217; a
lil&#8217; bit of sleep &#8217;longside that white trash Mo&#8217;ton&#8217;s place, I done
heah dey all plannin&#8217; to git out warrant for to arres&#8217; Massa Fairfax
and Massa Pine and Massa Ma&#8217;sh for a-killin&#8217; dem men las&#8217; week; and
I heah dem say dey gwine fer to gib dem trial, and if dey fight dey gwine done
shoot &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>is</i> serious news, Pete,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Who were
talking?&#8221; But Pete, who was already frightened half to death, grew
suddenly cautious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217; jest rightly know, sah,&#8221; he said sullenly. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t tell. Jes&#8217; Massa Mo&#8217;ton. He say he gwine sw&#8217;ar in good big
posse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can believe that,&#8221; said I thoughtfully. &#8220;Pete,&#8221; I
turned on him suddenly, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know they&#8217;d skin you alive
if they found out you&#8217;d been here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pete was shaking violently, and at my words a strong <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_349'></a>349</span> shudder went through his frame, and his
teeth struck faintly together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Massa Fairfax is quality, sah,&#8221; he replied with a certain
dignity. &#8220;I jest a pore nigger, but I knows quality when I sees it, and I
don&#8217;t aim to have no pore white truck kill none of my folks if I can help
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pete,&#8221; said I, fully satisfied, &#8220;you are a good fellow.
Now get along back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He disappeared before the words were fairly out of my mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yank,&#8221; I announced, returning to the fire, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
to go uptown. That was Pete, Barnes&#8217;s nigger, to say that they&#8217;ve
got out a legal warrant for the express messengers&#8217; arrest for that
killing last week. Neat little scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>I found Danny Randall in his accustomed place. At a hint he sent for Dr.
Rankin. To the two I unfolded the plot. Both listened in silence until I had
quite finished. Then Danny leaped to his feet and hit the table with his closed
fist.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fools!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I gave them credit for more sense.
Hit at Danny Randall&#8217;s men, will they? Well, they&#8217;ll find that Danny
Randall can protect his own! Forgotten that little point, have they?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cool, impassive, mild little man had changed utterly. His teeth bared,
the muscles of his cheeks tightened, two deep furrows appeared between his eyes,
which sparkled and danced. From the most inoffensive looking creature possible
to imagine he had become suddenly menacing and dangerous.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350'></a>350</span>&#8220;What do
you intend, Randall?&#8221; asked Dr. Rankin. He was leaning slightly forward,
and he spoke in a gentle voice, but his hand was clenched on the table, and his
figure was rigid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; repeated Randall fiercely; &#8220;why, run that gang out of
town, of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you said the time was not ripe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll ripen it!&#8221; said Danny Randall.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351'></a>351</span><a id='link_38'></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VIGILANTES</span></h2>

<p>Danny Randall issued his orders as a general would. First he sent warning
word to Cal Marsh, still nursing his shoulder. Through one of his barkeepers he
caused to be called to his presence four men. Three of them were miners, the
fourth a lookout at the Empire. He met them in his little room, quite openly,
which, as I have explained, was in accordance with his usual custom. He detailed
the exact situation in a few words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he ended, &#8220;we get busy. Are you in?&#8221;</p>

<p>Each assented, with apparent deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he briskly, &#8220;Munroe, you go to the lower trail,
near the big oak at the second crossing. Wait there. If the express messengers
have not passed by to-morrow morning at ten o&#8217;clock, return here. If they
do come by, stop them, and tell them to proceed by the cut-off to the place they
know of, and to wait there for me. Understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>To each of the other four men he assigned a different watching on other
trails, giving them the same instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now git!&#8221; he finished.</p>

<p>After informing Yank of my projected absence, I waited at the appointed place
until the appointed time, then returned to the Bella Union.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_352'></a>352</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Danny greeted
my report; &#8220;they came across the Hog&#8217;s Back, and are now safely in
hiding. Here,&#8221; he gave me a slip of paper. &#8220;During the day contrive
to see these men. Make it casual and easy, as though you just happened to see
them. Chat a few minutes and tell them this: &#8216;Danny Randall calls a secret
miners&#8217; meeting at the upper horse flat at nine o&#8217;clock to-night.
Slip up there without being seen.&#8217; Be sure to let them understand that it
is <i>I</i> who am issuing the call. Get them to tell you whether they will or
will not come.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the slip of paper and read over the half dozen names it contained.
They were all known to me; so I nodded my comprehension and went out.</p>

<p>All the rest of the day I loafed about, chatting with dozens of people, among
the others with Morton himself. That individual professed great zeal for law and
order, and told of the wonderful things he, as sheriff, intended to accomplish.
Among the lot I contrived to include the six men whose names were on my paper,
and to deliver my message. I explained as far as I knew, and got from each a
definite and emphatic promise to be present.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time this thing was brought to a head,&#8221; said one man.
&#8220;If Danny Randall is taking hold of it, I enlist.&#8221;</p>

<p>I returned to report these facts, received an indifferent nod, and, under
further instruction, went quietly to camp to await the agreed hour.</p>

<p>We started up the trail about eight o&#8217;clock. Yank insisted that he was
going, if he had to roll all the way; but after a little we simultaneously
remembered that the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_353'></a>353</span> Moreñas had owned horses. One of these I caught,
and on it Yank rode to the place of rendezvous.</p>

<p>The night was very black. After we had entered the woods its darkness seemed
at first to hang in front of my eyes like a filmy curtain, so that I fairly
groped, as one would when blindfolded. In the open a faint starlight helped us,
but after we had entered the pines we had fairly to proceed by instinct. I
remember feeling a shock of surprise once, when we skirted the river, at seeing
plainly the whiteness of the rapids, as though the water were giving off a light
of its own. Straight overhead were scattered patches of stars with misty abysses
of blackness between them. Only after an interval did I appreciate that these
apparent abysses were in reality the tops of trees!</p>

<p>We felt our way slowly, the soft muzzle of the horse at my shoulder.
Gradually our pupils expanded to the utmost, so that we caught ghostly
intimations of gray rocks, of dust patches, or seized the loom of a tree or the
opening of a forest aisle. Luckily the trail was well marked. We had only to
stick to it.</p>

<p>At the Flat Rock we were halted by a low-voiced command. I gave the password,
as instructed by Danny Randall. This experience was once repeated, a little
farther on. Then, as we neared the upper horse flat, we were stopped by a man
who flashed a dark lantern in our faces, scrutinized us for a moment, shut off
his light, and told us to go forward.</p>

<p>We found a small fire behind a screen of firs, and around or near it the
figures of a dozen men. They stood silent and scattered a little apart from the
firelight. We could <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_354'></a>354</span> not make out their features. From time to time
other men came in, singly or in couples, until probably twenty-five were
gathered. Then ensued a few moments of waiting. A sudden stir proclaimed fresh
arrivals, and four newcomers strode briskly to the fire. As the light fell on
them I recognized Randall and the three express riders.</p>

<p>Danny kicked together the fire until it flared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody put some more wood on this,&#8221; he said in his natural
voice. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to see each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment the flames were leaping. I looked about me with considerable
interest to see who of the camp had been summoned. I must confess to a few
surprises, such as the gambler from the Empire, but in general the gathering
consisted of those whom I should have characterized as solid
citizens&#8211;Barnes, the hotel-keeper, Himmelwright, and men of his stripe.
They were all armed, and all very grave and sober. Danny ran his eye over us one
by one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meeting come to order,&#8221; he commanded briskly. &#8220;This is a
Vigilante meeting. I hope you all realize what that means. There are just thirty
of us here; and Morton&#8217;s gang is probably a hundred strong when it is all
together. We cannot fight them; but we can give the honest, decent men of this
camp a chance to fight them. I myself believe the honest men will back us, and
am willing to risk it. If any of you who are here now think differently, say
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, but no one spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;If anybody doesn&#8217;t want to go into this, now is the time to back
out. Just keep your mouths shut, that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused again, but again no one moved.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_355'></a>355</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; observed Danny
with satisfaction. He lifted a paper. &#8220;Listen to this: &#8216;We the undersigned
agree, as we are decent men, to stand by each other to the last, to avenge the
death of any one of us, and to obey the orders of our leaders. And if we fail in
this may God deny us mercy.&#8217; Boys,&#8221; said Danny Randall earnestly,
&#8220;this is serious. If we start this now, we&#8217;ve got to see it through.
We are not much on Bible oaths, any one of us, but we must promise. Frank
Munroe, step forward!&#8221;</p>

<p>I obeyed. The little man stared up into my eyes, and I will freely confess
that never have I experienced quite the queer sensation it gave me. Danny
Randall had become not only formidable, but great. He seemed to see through into
the back of my mind. I braced myself as though to resist some strong physical
force.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you, Frank Munroe, subscribe to this document as a man of honour,
so help you God?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; I answered solemnly, and affixed my signature below that
of Danny Randall. And queerly enough, as I stepped aside, I felt somehow that I
had assisted at something sacred.</p>

<p>One by one Danny Randall called us forward and administered his simple oath.
The fire leaped, and with it the mighty shadows. Outside the circle of light the
tall pines and fir-trees watched us like a multitude standing witness. The
men&#8217;s faces were grave. There was about the roughest of them something
noble, reflected from the earnest spirit of justice.</p>

<p>Randall had the plans all made, and he detailed them rapidly. We were to
arrest four men only, and he named <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_356'></a>356</span> them&#8211;Morton, Scar-face Charley, who had
recovered, a gambler named Catlin, and Jules, the proprietor of the Empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crawford is back in town,&#8221; said some one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it five then,&#8221; said Danny instantly.</p>

<p>We had a long discussion over all this. Many other names were suggested.
Danny agreed that they were those of men guilty of the worst crimes, but
maintained that the first thing to do was to get hold of the real leaders, the
brains and motive power of the gang. The five first designated filled that
description.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we really prove anything against them?&#8221; asked someone.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Danny instantly, &#8220;we cannot. Does any one here
think any of them guiltless? Consult your consciences, gentlemen. I agree with
you that it is a fearful thing to take a man&#8217;s life. Vote carefully.
Consult your consciences.&#8221;</p>

<p>We balloted at last on each name separately, and the five leaders were
condemned to death.</p>

<p>Next came up the vital questions of ways and means. Many were in favour of a
night surprise, and an immediate hanging before the desperadoes could be
organized for defence. Danny had a hard time showing them good reasons against
this course, but at last he succeeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be done deliberately and publicly,&#8221; he maintained.
&#8220;Otherwise it fails of its effect. We&#8217;ve got to show the gang that
the camp is against them; and that won&#8217;t be done by hanging some of them
secretly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose the camp doesn&#8217;t back us up?&#8221; queried a miner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357'></a>357</span>&#8220;Remember
your oath, gentlemen,&#8221; was Danny&#8217;s only reply to this.</p>

<p>It was decided at last that five committees should be appointed to arrest
each of the five men, that the prisoners should be confined in a certain
isolated log cabin, and that the execution should take place in broad daylight.
There remained only to apportion the committees. This was done, and at about two
or three o&#8217;clock we quietly dispersed. I was instructed to coöperate with
three of the miners in the arrest of Catlin.</p>

<p>With the members of my committee I returned to our own camp, there to await
the appointed hour of seven. This had been selected for several reasons: it was
daylight, the roughs would be at home, and the community, although afoot, would
not yet have gone to work. While waiting we cooked ourselves some hot coffee and
made some flapjacks. The chill, gray time of day had come, the period of low
vitality, and we shivered with the cold and with excitement. Nobody had much to
say. We waited grimly for the time to pass.</p>

<p>About six o&#8217;clock Yank arose, seized his long rifle and departed for
the log cabin that had been designated as the jail. His lameness had prevented
him from being appointed on one of the arresting committees, but he had no
intention of being left out. A half hour later we followed him into town.</p>

<p>It was a heavenly fall morning of the sort that only mountain California can
produce. The camp was beginning to awaken to its normal activity. I remember
wondering vaguely how it could be so calm and unconcerned. My <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358'></a>358</span> heart was beating
violently, and I had to clench my teeth tight to keep them from chattering. This
was not fear, but a high tension of excitement. As we strolled past the Bella
Union with what appearance of nonchalance we could muster, Danny Randall nodded
at us from the doorway. By this we knew that Catlin was to be found at his own
place.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359'></a>359</span><a id='link_39'></a>CHAPTER XXXIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VIGILANTES (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2>

<p>Catlin dwelt in a detached room back of the Empire, together with one of the
other professional gamblers. We lounged around the corner of the Empire
building. The door of the cabin was shut. Outside we hung back, hesitating and a
little uncertain. None of us was by nature or training a man of violence, and we
experienced the reluctance of men about to plunge into cold water. Nobody was
more than pardonably afraid, and of course we had every intention of seeing the
affair through. Then suddenly in the actual face of the thing itself my
excitement drained from me like a tide receding. My nerves steadied, my
trembling stilled. Never had I felt more cool in my life. Drawing my revolver, I
pushed open the door and entered the building.</p>

<p>Catlin was in the act of washing his face, and him I instantly covered with
my weapon. His companion was still abed. On my entrance the latter had
instinctively raised on his elbow, but immediately dropped back as he saw the
figures of my companions darkening the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen?&#8221; demanded Catlin.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must come with us,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>He showed no concern, but wiped carefully his face and hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360'></a>360</span>&#8220;I will be
ready in a minute,&#8221; said he, throwing aside the towel, and rolling down
his shirt sleeves. He advanced toward a bench on which his coat had been flung.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be with you as soon as I can put on my coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced toward that garment and saw the muzzle of a revolver peeping out
from beneath it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hand your coat to you,&#8221; said I quickly. Catlin turned
deadly pale, but spoke with his usual composure.</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I wanted for?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;For being a road agent, a thief, and an accessory to robberies and
murders,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am innocent of all&#8211;as innocent as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no possibility of a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sentence is death,&#8221; I told him.</p>

<p>For a single instant his dark face lit up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221; he flashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; urged one of my companions.</p>

<p>With one man on either side and another behind, revolvers drawn, we marched
our prisoner in double-quick time past the rear of the stores and saloons to the
agreed rendezvous. There we found Danny Randall and his committee with Morton.
Within the next few moments, in rapid succession, appeared the others with
Scar-face Charley, Crawford, and Jules.</p>

<p>The camp was already buzzing with excitement. Men poured out from the
buildings into the streets like disturbed ants. Danny thrust his prisoners into
the interior of the cabin, and drew us up in two lines outside. He impressed on
us that we must keep the military formation, and that <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_361'></a>361</span> we were to allow no one to approach.
Across the road about twenty yards away he himself laid a rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the dead-line,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Now you keep
the other side!&#8221;</p>

<p>In no time a mob of five hundred men had gathered. They surged restlessly to
and fro. The flash of weapons was everywhere to be seen. Cries rent the
air&#8211;demands, threats, oaths, and insults so numerous and so virulent that
I must confess my heart failed me. At any instant I expected the mob to open
fire; they could have swept us away with a single volley. To my excited
imagination every man of that multitude looked a ruffian. We seemed alone
against the community. I could not understand why they did not rush us and have
it over with. Yet they hesitated. The fact of the matter is that the desperadoes
had no cohesion, no leaders; and they knew what none of us knew&#8211;namely,
that a good many of that crowd must be on our side. The roar and turmoil and
heat of discussion, argument, and threat rose and fell. In one of the lulls an
Irish voice yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang them!&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were greeted by a sullen assenting roar. Five hundred hands, each
armed, were held aloft. This unanimity produced an instant silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang who?&#8221; a truculent voice expressed the universal
uncertainty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang the road agents!&#8221; yelled back the little Irishman
defiantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for you, Irish; that took nerve!&#8221; muttered Johnny, at my
elbow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362'></a>362</span>Fifty threats
were hurled at the bold speaker, and the click of gunlocks preceded a surge in
his direction. Then from the mob went up a sullen, formidable muttering of
warning. No individual voice could be distinguished; but the total effect of
dead resistance and determination could not be mistaken. Instantly, at the words
so valiantly uttered, the spirit of cohesion had been born. The desperadoes
checked in surprise. We had friends. How many or how strong no one could guess;
but they were there, and in case of a battle they would fight.</p>

<p>On our side the line was a dead, grim silence. We stood, our weapons ready,
rigidly at attention. Occasionally one or the other of us muttered a warning
against those who showed symptoms of desiring to interfere.</p>

<p>In the meantime, three of our number had been proceeding methodically with
the construction of a gallows. This was made by thrusting five small pine butts,
about forty feet long, over a cross beam in the gable of the cabin and against
the roof inside. Large drygoods boxes were placed beneath for the trap.</p>

<p>About this time Danny Randall, who had been superintending the construction,
touched me on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fall back,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he instructed
several of us, after we had obeyed this command, &#8220;I want you to bring out
the prisoners and hold them in plain view. In case of rescue or attempted
escape, shoot them instantly. Don&#8217;t hesitate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think they would be safer inside the cabin,&#8221; I
suggested.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_363'></a>363</span>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; agreed Danny, &#8220;but I want
them here for the moral effect.&#8221;</p>

<p>We entered the cabin. The five prisoners were standing or sitting. Scar-face
Charley was alternately blaspheming violently, upbraiding his companions,
cursing his own luck, and uttering frightful threats against everybody who had
anything to do with this. Crawford was watching him contemptuously and every
once in a while advising him to &#8220;shut up!&#8221; Jules was alternately
cursing and crying. Morton sat at one side quite calm and very alert. Catlin
stared at the floor.</p>

<p>The moment we entered Catlin ran over to us and began to plead for his life.
He, better than the rest, with the possible exception of Morton, seemed to
realize the seriousness of his plight. From pleadings, which we received in
silence, he changed to arguments concerning his innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless,&#8221; replied one of our men. &#8220;That affair is
settled and cannot be changed. You are to be hanged. You cannot feel worse about
it than I do; but I could not help it if I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>Catlin stood for a moment as though overwhelmed; then he fell on his knees
before us and began to plead rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Anything but that! Do anything else
you want to with me! Cut off my ears and cut out my tongue! Disable me in any
way! You can certainly destroy my power for harm without taking my life!
Gentlemen! I want to live for my wife&#8211;my poor absent wife! I want time to
settle my affairs! O God! I am too wicked to die. I cannot go blood-stained and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364'></a>364</span> unforgiven into
the presence of the Eternal! Only let me go, and I will leave the country
forever!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the meantime Scar-face Charley and Crawford were cursing at us with an
earnestness and steadiness that compelled our admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up, Catlin!&#8221; cried Crawford at last.
&#8220;You&#8217;re going to hell, and you know it; but I&#8217;ll be there in
time to open the gate for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a fool of yourself,&#8221; advised Charley;
&#8220;there&#8217;s no use being afraid to die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Morton looked around at each of us in turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you know you are proceeding against a regularly constituted
officer of the law?&#8221; he reminded us. Receiving no reply, he beckoned me.
&#8220;Can I speak to you alone a moment?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will send for our leader,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I want no leader. You&#8217;ll do as
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>I approached him. In an anxious tone he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any way of getting out of this scrape? Think well!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; said I firmly. &#8220;You must die.&#8221;</p>

<p>With revolvers drawn we marched them outside. A wild yell greeted their
appearance. The cries were now mixed in sentiment. A hundred voices raised in
opposition were cried down by twice as many more. &#8220;Hang &#8217;em!&#8221;
cried some. &#8220;No, no, banish them!&#8221; cried others. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
hang them!&#8221; and blood-curdling threats. A single shot would have brought
on a pitched battle. Somehow eventually the tumult died down. Then Morton, who
had been awaiting his chance, spoke up in a strong voice.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365'></a>365</span>&#8220;I call on
you in the name of the law to arrest and disperse these law-breakers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Tom Cleveland?&#8221; spoke up a voice.</p>

<p>The appeal, which might otherwise have had its effect, was lost in the cries,
accusations, and counter-accusations that arose like a babel. Morton made no
further attempt. He better than any one realized, I think, the numerical
superiority against him.</p>

<p>The preparations were at length completed. Danny Randall motioned us to lead
forward the prisoners. Catlin struggled desperately, but the others walked
steadily enough to take their places on the drygoods boxes.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, gentlemen,&#8221; appealed Crawford in a loud
tone of voice, &#8220;give me time to write home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask him how much time he gave Tom Cleveland!&#8221; shouted a
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d only had a show,&#8221; retorted Crawford, &#8220;if
I&#8217;d known what you were after, you&#8217;d have had a gay time taking
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was some little delay in adjusting the cords.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to hang me, get at it!&#8221; said Jules with an
oath; &#8220;if not, I want you to tie a bandage on my finger; it&#8217;s
bleeding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your coat, Catlin,&#8221; said Crawford; &#8220;you never gave
me anything yet; now&#8217;s your chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Danny Randall broke in on this exchange.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are about to be executed,&#8221; said he soberly. &#8220;If you
have any dying requests to make, this is your last opportunity. They will be
carefully heeded.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366'></a>366</span>Scar-face
Charley broke in with a rough laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I look, boys, with a halter around my neck?&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>This grim effort was received in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your time is very short,&#8221; Danny reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said the desperado, &#8220;I want one more drink of
whiskey before I die.&#8221;</p>

<p>A species of uneasy consternation rippled over the crowd. Men glanced
meaningly at each other, murmuring together. Some of the countenances expressed
loathing, but more exhibited a surprised contempt. For a confused moment no one
seemed to know quite what to do or what answer to make to so bestial a dying
request. Danny broke the silence incisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised them their requests would be carefully heeded,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Give him the liquor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somebody passed up a flask. Charley raised it as high as he could, but was
prevented by the rope from getting it quite to his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You &#x2500;&#8221; he yelled at the man who held the rope.
&#8220;Slack off that rope and let a man take a parting drink, can&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Amid a dead silence the rope was slacked away. Charley took a long drink,
then hurled the half-emptied flask far out into the crowd.</p>

<p>To a question Crawford shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope God Almighty will strike every one of you with forked lightning
and that I shall meet you all in the lowest pit of hell!&#8221; he snarled.</p>

<p>Morton kept a stubborn and rather dignified silence. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_367'></a>367</span> Catlin alternately pleaded and wept.
Jules answered Danny&#8217;s question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing! Pull off my boots for me. I don&#8217;t want it to get
back to my old mother that I died with my boots on!&#8221;</p>

<p>In silence and gravely this ridiculous request was complied with. The crowd,
very attentive, heaved and stirred. The desperadoes, shouldering their way here
and there, were finding each other out, were gathering in little groups.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll try a rescue!&#8221; whispered the man next to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; Danny&#8217;s voice rang out, clear and menacing,
&#8220;do your duty!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the words, across the silence the click of gunlocks was heard as the
Vigilantes levelled their weapons at the crowd. From my position near the
condemned men I could see the shifting components of the mob freeze to
immobility before the menace of those barrels. At the same instant the man who
had been appointed executioner jerked the box from beneath Catlin&#8217;s
feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes one to hell!&#8221; muttered Charley.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope forked lightning will strike every strangling&#x2500;&#8221;
yelled Crawford. His speech was abruptly cut short as the box spun from under
his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kick away, old fellow!&#8221; said Scar-face Charley. &#8220;Me next!
I&#8217;ll be in hell with you in a minute! Every man for his principles! Hurrah
for crime! Let her rip!&#8221; and without waiting for the executioner, he
himself kicked the support away.</p>

<p>Morton died without a sign. Catlin, at the last, suddenly calmed, and met his
fate bravely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368'></a>368</span>Before the lull
resulting from the execution and the threat of the presented weapons could
break, Danny Randall spoke up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen!&#8221; he called clearly. &#8220;The roster of the
Vigilantes is open. Such of you as please to join the association for the
preservation of decency, law, and order in this camp can now do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guard lowered their arms and moved to one side. The crowd swept forward.
In the cabin the applicants were admitted a few at a time. Before noon we had
four hundred men on our rolls. Some of the bolder roughs ventured a few threats,
but were speedily overawed. The community had found itself, and was no longer
afraid.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371'></a>371</span><a id='link_40'></a>CHAPTER XL<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RAINS</span></h2>

<p>No sooner had this radical clean-up of the body politic been consummated than
the rains began. That means little to any but a Californian. To him it means
everything. We were quite new to the climate and the conditions, so that the
whole thing was a great surprise.</p>

<p>For a month past it had been threatening. The clouds gathered and piled and
blackened until they seemed fairly on the point of bursting. One would not have
given two cents for his chances of a dry skin were he to start on a journey
across the street. Yet somehow nothing happened. Late in the afternoon, perhaps,
the thunderous portents would thin. The diffused light would become stronger.
Far down in the west bars of sunlight would strike. And by evening the stars
shone brilliantly from a sky swept clear. After a dozen repetitions of this
phenomenon we ceased to pay any attention to it. Somebody named it &#8220;high
fog,&#8221; which did well enough to differentiate it from a genuine
rain-bringing cloud. Except for that peculiar gourd that looks exactly like a
watermelon, these &#8220;high fogs&#8221; were the best imitation of a real
thing I have ever seen. They came up like rain clouds, they looked precisely
like rain clouds, they went through all the performances of rain
clouds&#8211;except that never, never did they rain!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372'></a>372</span>But the day of
the Vigilante execution the sky little by little turned shimmering gray; so that
the sun shining from it looked like silver; and the shadows of objects were
diffused and pale. A tepid wind blew gently but steadily from the southeast. No
clouds were visible at first; but imperceptibly, around the peaks, filmy veils
formed seemingly out of the gray substance of the very sky itself. How these
thickened and spread I did not see; but when I came out of the Bella Union,
after a long and interesting evening of discussion, I found no stars; and, as I
stood looking upward, a large warm drop splashed against my face.</p>

<p>Sometime during the night it began to rain in earnest. We were awakened by
its steady drumming on the canvas of our tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord! but she sure is <i>raining</i>!&#8221; said Johnny across the
roar of sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tech the canvas!&#8221; warned Old. &#8220;If you do,
she&#8217;ll leak like a spout where you teched her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank heaven, that high fog scared us into ditching around the
tent,&#8221; said Cal fervently.</p>

<p>But our satisfaction was short-lived. We had ditched the tent, to be sure,
but we had badly underestimated the volume of a California downpour.</p>

<p>Before many minutes had passed Johnny gave a disgusted snort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lying in a marsh!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>He struck a light, and we all saw the water trickling in a dozen little
streams beneath the edge of the tent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_373'></a>373</span>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be ruined!&#8221; cried
Johnny comically.</p>

<p>He arose, and in doing so brushed his head violently against the slanting
canvas roof. Almost immediately thereafter the rays of the lantern were
reflected from tiny beads of water, like a sweat, appearing as though by magic
at that spot. They swelled, gathered, hesitated, then began to feel their way
slowly down the dry canvas. The trickle became a stream. A large drop fell
straight down. Another followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody need a drink?&#8221; inquired Cal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221; said Johnny contritely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be,&#8221; I consoled him. &#8220;The whole thing is
going to leak, if this keeps up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with going over to the Moreña cabin?&#8221;
queried Yank.</p>

<p>We hesitated a little. The events of the day had affected us all more deeply
than we liked to acknowledge; and nobody but Yank much liked the idea of again
entering that blood-stained abode.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d drown getting there,&#8221; said Cal at last. &#8220;I move
some of you fellows with two good arms rustle out and fix that ditch.&#8221; He
laughed. &#8220;Nothing like having a hole in you to get out of work.&#8221;</p>

<p>We took his advice, and managed to turn the flood, though we got very wet in
the process.</p>

<p>Then we returned to the tent, changed our clothes, crept into our blankets,
and wrapped ourselves close. The spot brushed by Johnny&#8217;s head dripped
steadily. Otherwise our roof shed well. The rain roared straight down with
steady, deadly persistency.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374'></a>374</span>&#8220;She
can&#8217;t keep this up long, anyway; that&#8217;s a comfort,&#8221; muttered
Johnny sleepily.</p>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t she? All next morning that flood came down without the let-up
of even a single moment. It had all the volume and violence of a black
thunderstorm at its height; only the worst of the thunderstorm lasts but a few
moments, while this showed no signs of ever intending to end. Our stout canvas
continued to turn the worst of it, but a fine spray was driven through, to our
great discomfort. We did not even attempt to build a fire, but sat around
wrapped in our damp blankets.</p>

<p>Until about two of the afternoon the deluge continued. Our unique topic of
conversation was the marvel of how it could keep it up! We could not imagine
more water falling were every stream and lake in the mountains to be lifted to
the heavens and poured down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where the devil does it all come from?&#8221; marvelled Old, again and
again. &#8220;Don&#8217;t seem like no resevoy, let alone clouds, could hold so
much!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where does it go to?&#8221; I supplemented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon some of those plains people could tell you,&#8221; surmised
Yank shrewdly.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock the downpour ceased as abruptly as though it had been
turned off at a spigot. Inside of twenty minutes the clouds had broken, to show
beyond them a dazzling blue sky. Intermittent flashes and bands of sunlight
glittered on the wet trees and bushes or threw into relief the black bands of
storm clouds near the horizon.</p>

<p>Immensely cheered, we threw aside our soggy blankets and sallied forth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375'></a>375</span>&#8220;Great
Christmas!&#8221; cried Johnny, who was in the advance. &#8220;Talk about your
mud!&#8221;</p>

<p>We did talk about it. It was the deepest, most tenacious, slipperiest, most
adhesive mud any fiend ever imagined. We slid and floundered as though we had on
skates; we accumulated balls of it underfoot; and we sank disconcertingly
half-leg deep at every third step. Our first intention had been to go up to
town; but we soon revised that, and went down to the Moreña cabin instead, with
the idea of looking after the two horses. The beasts, very shaggy underneath and
plastered above, stood humped up nose to tail. We looked into the cabin. The
roof had leaked like a sieve; and the interior was dripping in a thousand
places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon even the tent was better after all,&#8221; acknowledged Yank,
looking with disfavour on the muddy floor.</p>

<p>We returned to the tent and made shift to get a fire going. After cooking
some hot food, we felt better, and set about drying our blankets. In the cañon
we could hear the river roaring away hollowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet she&#8217;s on the rampage!&#8221; said Old.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet she&#8217;s got my cradle and all of my tools!&#8221; I
cried, struck with a sudden thought.</p>

<p>And then, about as we commenced to feel cheerful and contented again, the
scattered black clouds began to close ranks. One by one the patches of blue sky
narrowed and disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; cried Cal in astonishment, &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s
getting ready to rain again!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_376'></a>376</span>&#8220;Shucks!&#8221; replied Old, &#8220;It
can&#8217;t. There ain&#8217;t no more rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless there was, and plenty of it. We spent that second night shifting
as little as possible so as not to touch a new cold place in our sodden
blankets, while the waters roared down in almost a solid sheet.</p>

<p>This lasted the incredible period of four days! Nobody then knew anything
about measuring rainfall; but, judging by later experience, I should say we must
have had close to seven inches. There was not much we could do, except to get
wetter and wetter, although we made shift to double up at night, and to use the
extra blankets thus released to make a sort of double roof. This helped
some.</p>

<p>The morning of the fifth day broke dazzlingly clear. The sky looked burnished
as a blue jewel; the sunlight glittered like shimmering metal; distant objects
stood out plain-cut, without atmosphere. For the first time we felt encouraged
to dare that awful mud, and so slopped over to town.</p>

<p>We found the place fairly drowned out. No one, in his first year, thought of
building for the weather. Barnes&#8217;s hotel, the Empire and the Bella Union
had come through without shipping a drop, for they had been erected by men with
experience in the California climate; but almost everybody else had been leaked
upon a-plenty. And the deep dust of the travel-worn overland road had turned
into a morass beyond belief or description.</p>

<p>Our first intimation of a definite seasonal change came from our old friend
Danny Randall, who hailed us at once when he saw us picking our way gingerly
along the edge <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377'></a>377</span> of
the street. In answer to his summons we entered the Bella Union.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you boys weren&#8217;t quite drowned out,&#8221; he greeted us.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t look particularly careworn.&#8221;</p>

<p>We exchanged the appropriate comments; then Danny came at once to
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to pay off you three boys,&#8221; he told the
express messengers, &#8220;and I want to know what you want. I can give you the
dust, or I can give you an order on a San Francisco firm, just as you
choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Express business busted?&#8221; asked Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quit for the season,&#8221; Danny Randall told him,
&#8220;like everything else. In two weeks at most there won&#8217;t be a score
of men left in Italian Bar.&#8221; He observed our astonished incredulity,
smiled, and continued: &#8220;You boys came from the East, where it rains and
gets over it. But out here it doesn&#8217;t get over it. Have you been down to
look at the river? No? Well, you&#8217;d better take a look. There&#8217;ll be
no more bar mining done there for a while. And what&#8217;s a mining camp
without mining? Go talk to the men of &#8217;48. They&#8217;ll tell you. The season is
over, boys, until next spring; and you may just as well make up your minds to
hike out now as later. What are you laughing at?&#8221; he asked Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was just thinking of our big Vigilante organization,&#8221; he
chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s true that mighty few of the same lot will ever
get back to Italian Bar,&#8221; agreed Danny, &#8220;but it&#8217;s a good thing
for whatever community they may hit next year.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378'></a>378</span>Johnny and Old
elected to take their wages in dust; Cal decided on the order against the San
Francisco firm. Then we wandered down to where we could overlook the bar
itself.</p>

<p>The entire bed of the river was filled from rim to rim with a rolling brown
flood. The bars, sand-spits, gravel-banks had all disappeared. Whole trees
bobbed and sank and raised skeleton arms or tangled roots as they were swept
along by the current or caught back by the eddies; and underneath the roar of
the waters we heard the dull rumbling and crunching of boulders rolled beneath
the flood. A crowd of men was watching in idle curiosity. We learned that all
the cradles and most of the tools had been lost; and heard rumours of cabins or
camps located too low having been swept away.</p>

<p>That evening we held a very serious discussion of our prospects and plans.
Yank announced himself as fit to travel, and ready to do so, provided he could
have a horse; the express messengers were out of a job; I had lost all my tools,
and was heartily tired of gold washing, even had conditions permitted me to
continue. Beside which, we were all feeling quite rich and prosperous. We had
not made enormous fortunes as we had confidently anticipated when we left New
York, but we were all possessed of good sums of money. Yank had the least, owing
to the fact that he had been robbed of his Porcupine River product, and had been
compelled for nearly three months to lie idle; but even he could count on a
thousand dollars or so sent out from Hangman&#8217;s Gulch. I had the most, for
my digging had paid me better than had Johnny&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_379'></a>379</span> express riding. But much of my share
belonged of right to Talbot Ward.</p>

<p>Having once made up our minds to leave, we could not go too soon. A revulsion
seized us. In two days the high winds that immediately sprang up from the west
had dried the surface moisture. We said good-bye to all our friends&#8211;Danny
Randall, Dr. Rankin, Barnes, and the few miners with whom we had become
intimate. Danny was even then himself preparing to return to Sonoma as soon as
the road should be open to wagons. Dr. Rankin intended to accompany him,
ostensibly because he saw a fine professional opening at Sonoma, in reality
because in his shy, hidden fashion he loved Danny.</p>

<p>Nobody objecting, we commandeered the two horses that had belonged to the
Moreñas. One of them we packed with our few effects, and turned the other over
to Yank. Thus, trudging afoot, Johnny and I saw our last of Italian Bar. Thirty
years later I rode up there out of sheer curiosity. Most of the old cabins had
fallen in. The Bella Union was a drear and draughty wreck. The Empire was used
as a stable. Barnes&#8217;s place and Morton&#8217;s next door had burned down.
Only three of the many houses were inhabited. In two of them dwelt old men,
tending small gardens and orchards. I do not doubt they too were Forty-niners;
but I did not stop. The place was full of too many ghosts.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380'></a>380</span><a id='link_41'></a>CHAPTER XLI<br /><span class='h2fs'>WE GO OUT</span></h2>

<p>We made our way out of the hills without adventure worth noting. The road was
muddy, and a good deal washed. In fact, we had occasionally to do considerable
man&oelig;uvring to find a way at all around the landslides from the hills
above.</p>

<p>As we descended we came upon traces of the great exodus that was taking place
from the hills. All the miners were moving out. We found discarded articles of
camp equipment; we passed some people without any equipment at all. Sick men lay
under bushes without covering, or staggered painfully down the muddy trails.
Many were utterly without food. If it rained, as it did from frequent showers,
they took it as cheerfully as they could. This army of the unsuccessful was a
striking commentary on the luck of the mines.</p>

<p>Robbers most singularly lacked. I did not hear of a single case of violence
in all the rather slow journey out. The explanation did not seem difficult,
however. Those who travelled alone had nothing worth the taking; while those who
possessed gold went in numbers too strong to be attacked. The road agents had
gone straight to the larger cities. Nor, must I confess, did I see many examples
of compassion to the unfortunate. In spite of the sentimental <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381'></a>381</span> stories that have been
told&#8211;with real enough basis in isolated fact, probably&#8211;the time was
selfish. It was also, after eliminating the desperadoes and blacklegs,
essentially honest. Thus one day we came upon a wagon apparently deserted by the
roadside. On it was a rudely scrawled sign:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Will some kind person stay by my wagon. I am in distress looking
for my oxen. Please do not take anything, for I am poor, and the property is not
mine.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing had been touched, as near as I could make out. We travelled by easy
stages, and by a roundabout route, both because the road was bad, and because we
wanted to see the country. On our way we passed several other small camps. A
great many Chinese had come in, and were engaged in scratching over the
abandoned claims. In fact, one man told me that sometimes it was worth while to
file on some of the abandoned claims just to sell them to these patient people!
As we descended from the mountains we naturally came upon more and more
worked-out claims. Some had evidently been abandoned in disgust by men with
little stamina; but, sometimes, with a considerable humour. An effigy clad in
regulation gambler&#8217;s rig, including the white shirt, swayed and swung
slowly above the merest surface diggings. Across the shirt front these words
were written:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;<i>My claim failed!</i>&#8221;</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>And then below them:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&#8220;<i>Oh, Susannah! don&#8217;t you cry for me!<br />
I&#8217;m a-living dead in Californi-ee</i>&#8221;&#8211;</p>
</div> <!-- poetry -->

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382'></a>382</span> which was very bad as
doggerel, but probably very accurate as to its author&#8217;s state of mind.</p>

<p>One afternoon we turned off on a trail known to Old, and rode a few miles to
where the Pine family had made its farm. We found the old man and his tall sons
inhabiting a large two-roomed cabin situated on a flat. They had already
surrounded a field with a fence made of split pickets and rails, and were
working away with the tireless energy of the born axemen at enclosing still
more. Their horses had been turned into ploughing; and from somewhere or other
they had procured a cock and a dozen hens. Of these they were inordinately
proud, and they took great pains to herd them in every night away from wildcats
and other beasts. We stayed with them four days, and we had a fine time. Every
man of them was keenly interested in the development of the valley and the
discovery of its possibilities. We discussed apples, barley, peaches, apricots,
ditches, irrigation, beans, hogs, and a hundred kindred topics, to
Johnny&#8217;s vast disgust. I had been raised on a New England farm; Yank had
experienced agricultural vicissitudes in the new country west of the
Alleghanies; and the Pines had scratched the surface of the earth in many
localities. But this was a new climate and a new soil to all of us; and we had
nothing to guide us. The subject was fascinating. Johnny was frankly bored with
it all, but managed to have a good time hunting for the game with which the
country abounded.</p>

<p>For a brief period Yank and I quite envied the lot of these pioneers who had
a settled stake in the country.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could go in for this sort of thing,&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383'></a>383</span>&#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; urged old man Pine. &#8220;There&#8217;s a flat just
above us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get hold of this land?&#8221; I inquired curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just took it&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it belong to anybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s part of one of these big Greaser ranchos,&#8221; said Pine
impatiently. &#8220;I made a good try to git to the bottom of it. One fellar
says he owns it, and will sell; then comes another that says <i>he</i> owns it
and won&#8217;t sell. And so on. They don&#8217;t nohow use this country, except
a few cattle comes through once in a while. I got tired of monkeying with them
and I came out here and squatted. If I owe anybody anything, they got to show me
who it is. I don&#8217;t believe none of them knows themselves who it really
belongs to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to put a lot of work into a place, and then have to
move out,&#8221; said I doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see anybody move me out!&#8221; observed old man
Pine grimly.</p>

<p>Farther up in the hills they were putting together the framework of a
sawmill, working on it at odd times when the ranch itself did not demand
attention. It was built of massive hewn timbers, raised into place with great
difficulty. They had no machinery as yet, but would get that later out of their
first farming profits.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no hurry about it anyway,&#8221; explained Pine,
&#8220;for as yet there ain&#8217;t no demand for lumber yereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; exploded Johnny with a derisive shriek of
laughter, &#8220;unless you&#8217;re going to sell it to the elks and
coyotes!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384'></a>384</span>Pine turned
toward him seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all good land yere,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and they&#8217;ll
want lumber.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks mighty good to me,&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you settle?&#8221; urged Pine.</p>

<p>&#8220;And me with fifteen hundred good dollars?&#8221; replied Yank.
&#8220;It ain&#8217;t such an everlasting fortune; but it&#8217;ll git me a
place back home; and I&#8217;ve had my fun. This country is too far off.
I&#8217;m going back home.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this sentiment Johnny and I heartily agreed. It is a curious fact that not
one man in ten thousand even contemplated the possibility of making California
his permanent home. It was a place in which to get as rich as he could, and then
to leave.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we left our backwoods friends reluctantly; and at the top of the
hill we stopped our two horses to look back on the valley. It lay, with its
brown, freshly upturned earth, its scattered broad oaks, its low wood-crowned
knolls, as though asleep in the shimmering warm floods of golden sunshine.
Through the still air we heard plainly the beat of an axe, and the low, drowsy
clucking of hens. A peaceful and grateful feeling of settled permanence, to
which the restless temporary life of mining camps had long left us strangers,
filled us with the vague stirrings of envy.</p>

<p>The feeling soon passed. We marched cheerfully away, our hopes busy with what
we would do when we reached New York. Johnny and I had accumulated very fair
sums of money, in spite of our loss at the hands of the robbers, what with the
takings at Hangman&#8217;s Gulch, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_385'></a>385</span> what was left from the robbery, and Italian Bar.
These sums did not constitute an enormous fortune, to be sure. There was nothing
spectacular in our winnings; but they totalled about five times the amount we
could have made at home; and they represented a very fair little stake with
which to start life. We were young.</p>

<p>We found Sacramento under water. A sluggish, brown flood filled the town and
spread far abroad over the flat countryside. Men were living in the second
stories of such buildings as possessed second stories, and on the roofs of
others. They were paddling about in all sorts of improvised boats and rafts. I
saw one man keeping a precarious equilibrium in a baker&#8217;s trough; and
another sprawled out face down on an India rubber bed paddling overside with his
hands.</p>

<p>We viewed these things from the thwarts of a boat which we hired for ten
dollars. Our horses we had left outside of town on the highlands. Everywhere we
passed men and shouted to them a cheery greeting. Everybody seemed optimistic
and inclined to believe that the flood would soon go down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, she&#8217;s killed the rats,&#8221; one man shouted in answer
to our call.</p>

<p>We grinned an appreciation of what we thought merely a facetious reply. Rats
had not yet penetrated to the mines, so we did not know anything about them.
Next day, in San Francisco, we began to apprehend the man&#8217;s remark.</p>

<p>Thus we rowed cheerfully about, having a good time at the other
fellow&#8217;s expense. Suddenly Johnny, who was <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_386'></a>386</span> steering, dropped his paddle with an
exclamation. Yank and I turned to see what had so struck him. Beyond the trees
that marked where the bank of the river ought to be we saw two tall smokestacks
belching forth a great volume of black smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;A steamer!&#8221; cried Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and a good big one!&#8221; I added.</p>

<p>We lay to our oars and soon drew alongside. She proved to be a side wheeler,
of fully seven hundred tons, exactly like the craft we had often seen plying the
Hudson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now how do you suppose they got her out here?&#8221; I marvelled.</p>

<p>She was almost completely surrounded by craft of all descriptions; her decks
were crowded. We read the name <i>McKim</i> on her paddle boxes.</p>

<p>A man with an official cap appeared at the rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bound for San Francisco?&#8221; I called to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Off in two minutes,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the fare?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys,&#8221; said I to my comrades, at the same time seizing
a dangling rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; cried Yank. &#8220;How about our two horses and our
blankets, and this boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>I cast my eye around, and discovered a boy of fourteen or fifteen in the
stern of a neat fisherman&#8217;s dory a few feet away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; I called to him. &#8220;Do you want two good horses and
some blankets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t got any money.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_387'></a>387</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need any. These are free.
We&#8217;re going down on this boat. You&#8217;ll find the outfit under the big
white oak two miles above the forks on the American. They&#8217;re yours if
you&#8217;ll go get them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; he demanded suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two things: return this boat to its owner&#8211;a man named Lilly who
lives&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the boat,&#8221; the boy interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other is to be sure to go up to-day after those horses.
They&#8217;re picketed out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed the boy, whose enthusiasm kindled as his
belief in the genuineness of the offer was assured.</p>

<p>I seized a rope, swung myself up to the flat fender, and thence to the
deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; I called to Yank and Johnny, who were hesitating.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll cost more than those horses and blankets are worth to
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon they followed me. The boy made fast our boat to his own. Five
minutes later we were dropping down the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what I call real luxury,&#8221; said Johnny, returning from an
inspection of our craft. &#8220;There&#8217;s a barroom, and a gambling layout,
and velvet carpets and chairs, mirrors, a minstrel show, and all the fixings.
Now who&#8217;d expect to run against a layout like this on the
river?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;d like to know is how they got her out here,&#8221; said
I. &#8220;Look at her! She&#8217;s a river boat. A six-foot wave ought to swamp
her!&#8221;</p>

<p>We thought of a half dozen solutions, and dismissed <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_388'></a>388</span> them all. The discussion, however,
served its purpose in inflaming our curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to find some one who knows,&#8221; I announced at
last.</p>

<p>This was not so easy. The captain was of course remote and haughty and
inaccessible, and the other officers were too busy handling the ship and the
swarming rough crowd to pay any attention to us. The crew were new hands.
Finally, however, we found in the engine room a hard bitten individual with a
short pipe and some leisure. To him we proffered our question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sailed her,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Around the Horn?&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>He looked at me a bitter instant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sailing wasn&#8217;t very good across the plains, <i>at that
time</i>,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Little by little we got his story. I am not a seafaring man, but it seems to
me one of the most extraordinary feats of which I have ever heard. The lower
decks of the <i>McKim</i> had been boarded up with heavy planks; some of her
frailer gimcracks of superstructure had been dismantled, and then she had been
sent under her own power on the long journey around the Horn. Think of it! A
smooth-water river boat, light draught, top heavy, frail in construction, sent
out to battle with the might of three oceans! However, she made it; and after
her her sister ship, the <i>Senator</i>, and they made money for their owners,
and I am glad of it. That certainly was a gallant enterprise!</p>

<p>She was on this trip jammed full of people, mostly <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_389'></a>389</span> those returning from the mines. A trip
on the <i>McKim</i> implied a certain amount of prosperity, so we were a jolly
lot. The weather was fine, and a bright moon illuminated the swollen river. We
had drinkers, songsters, debaters, gamblers, jokers, and a few inclined to be
quarrelsome, all of which added to the variety of the occasion. I wandered
around from one group to another, thoroughly enjoying myself, both out on deck
and in the cabins. It might be added that there were no sleepers!</p>

<p>Along toward midnight, as I was leaning on the rail forward watching the
effect of the moon on the water and the shower of sparks from the twin stacks
against the sky, I was suddenly startled by the cry of &#8220;man
overboard,&#8221; and a rush toward the stern. I followed as quickly as I was
able. The paddle wheels had been instantly reversed, and a half dozen sailors
were busily lowering a boat. A crowd of men, alarmed by the trembling of the
vessel as her way was checked, poured out from the cabins. The fact that I was
already on deck gave me an advantageous post; so that I found myself near the
stern rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was leaning against the rail,&#8221; one was explaining excitedly,
&#8220;and it give way, and in he went. He never came up!&#8221;</p>

<p>Everybody was watching eagerly the moonlit expanse of the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s a goner,&#8221; said a man after a few moments.
&#8220;He ain&#8217;t in sight nowhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he is!&#8221; cried a half dozen voices all at once.</p>

<p>A head shot into sight a few hundred yards astern, blowing the silvered water
aside. The small boat, which <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_390'></a>390</span> was now afloat, immediately headed in his
direction, and a moment later he was hauled aboard amid frantic cheers. The
dripping victim of the accident clambered to the deck.</p>

<p>It was Johnny!</p>

<p>He was beside himself with excitement, sputtering with rage and uttering
frantic threats against something or somebody. His eyes were wild, and he fairly
frothed at the mouth. I seized him by the arm. He stared at me, then became
coherent, though he still spluttered. Johnny was habitually so quietly reserved
as far as emotions go that his present excitement was at first utterly
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>It seemed that he had been leaning against the rail, watching the moonlight,
when suddenly it had given way beneath his weight and he had fallen into the
river.</p>

<p>&#8220;They had no business to have so weak a rail!&#8221; he cried
bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re here, all right,&#8221; I said soothingly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no great harm done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t there?&#8221; he snarled.</p>

<p>Then we learned how the weight of the gold around his waist had carried him
down like a plummet; and we sensed a little of the desperate horror with which
he had torn and struggled to free himself from that dreadful burden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d burst!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And then he had torn off the belt, and had shot to the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s down there,&#8221; he said more calmly, &#8220;every
confounded yellow grain of it.&#8221; He laughed a little. &#8220;Broke!&#8221;
said he. &#8220;No New York in mine!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391'></a>391</span>The crowd
murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gol darn it, boys, it&#8217;s rotten hard luck!&#8221; cried a big
miner with some heat. &#8220;Who&#8217;ll chip in?&#8221;</p>

<p>At the words Johnny recovered himself, and his customary ease of manner
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged, boys,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I&#8217;ve still got my
health. I don&#8217;t need charity. Guess I&#8217;ve been doing the baby act;
but I was damn mad at that rotten old rail. Anyway,&#8221; he laughed,
&#8220;there need nobody say in the future that there&#8217;s no gold in the
lower Sacramento. There is; I put it there myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tall miner slowly stowed away his buckskin sack, looking keenly in
Johnny&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have a drink, anyway,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hell, yes!&#8221; agreed Johnny, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have a
drink!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392'></a>392</span><a id='link_42'></a>CHAPTER XLII<br /><span class='h2fs'>SAN FRANCISCO AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>We drew up to San Francisco early in the afternoon, and we were, to put it
mildly, thoroughly astonished at the change in the place. To begin with, we now
landed at a long wharf projecting from the foot of Sacramento Street instead of
by lighter. This wharf was crowded by a miscellaneous mob, collected apparently
with no other purpose than to view our arrival. Among them we saw many
specialized types that had been lacking to the old city of a few months
ago&#8211;sharp, keen, businesslike clerks whom one could not imagine at the
rough work of the mines; loafers whom one could not imagine at any work at all;
dissolute, hard-faced characters without the bold freedom of the road agents;
young green-looking chaps who evidently had much to learn and who were
exceedingly likely to pay their little fortunes, if not their lives, in the
learning. On a hogshead at one side a street preacher was declaiming.</p>

<p>Johnny had by now quite recovered his spirits. I think he was helped greatly
by the discovery that he still possessed his celebrated diamond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not broke yet!&#8221; said he triumphantly. &#8220;You see I was a
wise boy after all! Wish I had two of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>We disembarked, fought our way to one side, and discussed our plans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393'></a>393</span>&#8220;Hock the
diamond first,&#8221; said Johnny, who resolutely refused to borrow from me;
&#8220;then hair-cut, shave, bath, buy some more clothes, grub, drink, and hunt
up Talbot and see what he&#8217;s done with the dust we sent down from
Hangman&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>That program seemed good. We strolled toward shore, with full intention of
putting it into immediate execution. &#8220;Immediate&#8221; proved to be a
relative term; there was too much to see.</p>

<p>First we stopped for a moment to hear what the preacher had to say. He was a
tall, lank man with fine but rather fanatical features, dressed in a long black
coat, his glossy head bare. In spite of the numerous counter-attractions he had
a crowd; and he was holding it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re standing on a whiskey barrel!&#8221; called some one; and
the crowd yelled with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;True, my friend,&#8221; retorted the preacher with undaunted good
nature, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll venture to say this is the first time a whiskey
barrel has ever been appropriated to so useful a purpose. The critter in it will
do no harm if it is kept underfoot. Never let it get above your feet!&#8221;</p>

<p>A boat runner, a squat, humorous-faced negro with flashing teeth and a ready
flow of language, evidently a known and appreciated character, mounted the head
of a pile at some little distance and began to hold forth in a deep voice on the
advantages of some sort of an excursion on the bay. A portion of the
preacher&#8217;s crowd began to drift in the direction of the new
attraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! ho! ho!&#8221; cried the preacher suddenly in tremendous volume.
&#8220;Ho! All ye who want to go to heaven, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_394'></a>394</span> now&#8217;s your time! A splendid line of celestial
steamers will run for a few days from San Francisco to the port of Glory, a
country every way superior to California, having in it the richest gold diggings
ever discovered, the very streets of the city being paved with gold. In that
country are oceans of lager beer and drinks of every kind, all free; pretty
women also, and pleasures of endless variety exceeding the dreams of Mohammed as
far as the brightness of the meridian sun exceeds the dim twinkle of the
glowworm! Program for the voyage: embarkation amid the melody of the best band
in the world; that music that so attracted you this morning not to be mentioned
in comparison. Appropriate entertainments for each week day, to be announced
daily. Each Sunday to be celebrated, first, with a grand feast, closing with a
rich profusion of beer, champagne, good old port, whiskey punch, brandy smashes,
Tom and Jerry, etc. Second, a game of cards. Third, a grand ball in upper
saloon. Fourth, a dog fight. Fifth, a theatrical performance in the evening. If
I could truthfully publish such an ad as that I think about two sermons would
convert this city.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crowd had all turned back to him, laughing good-humouredly. The preacher
stretched out his long bony arm, and held forth. His talk was against gambling,
and it had, I am afraid, but little real effect. Nevertheless he was listened
to; and at the end of his talk everybody contributed something to a
collection.</p>

<p>At the land end of the wharf we ran into the most extraordinary collection of
vehicles apparently in an inextricable tangle, that was further complicated by
the fact <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395'></a>395</span> that most
of the horses were only half broken. They kicked and reared, their drivers
lashed and swore, the wagons clashed together. There seemed no possible way out
of the mess; and yet somehow the wagons seemed to get loaded and to draw out
into the clear. Occasionally the drivers were inclined to abandon their craft
and do battle with the loaded ends of their whips; but always a peacemaker
descended upon them in the person of a large voluble individual in whom I
recognized my former friend and employer, John McGlynn. Evidently John had no
longer a monopoly of the teaming business; but, as evidently, what he said went
with this wild bunch.</p>

<p>Most of the wagons were loading goods brought from the interiors of
storehouses alongside the approach to the wharf. In these storehouses we
recognized the hulls of ships, but so shored up, dismantled, and cut into by
doors and stories that of their original appearance only their general shapes
remained. There was a great number of these storehouses along the shore, some of
them being quite built about by piles and platforms, while two were actually
inland several hundred feet. I read the name <i>Niantic</i> on the stern of one
of them; and found it to have acquired in the landward side a square false
front. It was at that time used as a hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks as if they&#8217;d taken hold of Talbot&#8217;s idea
hard,&#8221; observed Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; cried Johnny, &#8220;will one of you drinking men kindly
take a look and inform me if I&#8217;ve gone wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>This remark was called forth by the discovery, as we neared the shore, of
hordes of rats. They were large, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_396'></a>396</span> fat, saucy rats; and they strolled about in broad
daylight as if they owned the place. They sat upright on sacks of grain; they
scampered across the sidewalks; they scuttled from behind boxes; they rustled
and squeaked and fought and played in countless droves. The ground seemed alive
with them. It was a most astonishing sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you look at that dog!&#8221; cried Yank disgustedly.</p>

<p>Across an open doorway, blinking in the sun, lay a good-looking fox terrier.
His nose was laid between his paws, and within two yards of that nose a large
brown rat disported itself with a crust of bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Lord!&#8221; cried Johnny, his sporting blood aboil. &#8220;Here,
pup, sic &#8217;em! sic &#8217;em!&#8221; He indicated the game urgently. The
fox terrier rolled up one eye, wagged his stub tail&#8211;but did not even raise
his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; observed the dog&#8217;s owner, who had appeared in the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him?&#8221; demanded Johnny indignantly;
&#8220;is he sick?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he ain&#8217;t sick,&#8221; replied the owner sadly; &#8220;but he
ain&#8217;t got no use for rats. I bought him for damn near his weight in gold
dust when the <i>Panama</i> came in last month. He was the best ratter you ever
see. I reckon he must&#8217;ve killed a million rats the first week. But, Lord!
he got sick of rats. I reckon a rat could go right up and pull his whiskers now,
and he&#8217;d never mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>We condoled with the <i>blasé</i> dog, and moved on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same old mud,&#8221; observed Yank.</p>

<p>The place was full of new buildings, some of them <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_397'></a>397</span> quite elaborate two-story structures of
brick; and elevated plank sidewalks had taken the place of the old makeshifts.
Although the Plaza was still the centre of town, the streets immediately off it
had gained considerable dignity and importance. There were many clothing stores,
nearly all kept by Jews, and a number of new saloons and gambling houses. As we
were picking our way along we ran into an old acquaintance in the person of the
captain of the <i>Panama</i>. He recognized us at once, and we drew up for a
chat. After we had exchanged first news Johnny asked him if he knew of a place
where a fair price could be raised on the diamond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the jewellery store is your ticket, of course,&#8221; replied the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s a jewellery store, too!&#8221; cried Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a good one,&#8221; supplemented the captain. &#8220;Come along;
I&#8217;ll take you to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a good one, and carried a large stock of rings, chains, pins,
clocks, watches, and speaking trumpets. The latter two items were the most
prominent, for there were hundreds of watches, and apparently thousands of
speaking trumpets. They stood in rows on the shelves, and depended in ranks from
hooks and nails. Most of them were of silver or of silver gilt; and they were
plain, chased, engraved, hammered, or repousséd, with always an ample space for
inscription. After Johnny had concluded a satisfactory arrangement for his
diamond, I remarked on the preponderance of speaking trumpets. The man grinned
rather maliciously at our captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are a very favourite article for presentation <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398'></a>398</span> by grateful passengers
after a successful sea trip,&#8221; he said smoothly.</p>

<p>At this our captain exploded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221; he boomed. &#8220;I should think they were!
I&#8217;ve got a dozen of the confounded things; and as I&#8217;ve just got in
from a trip, I&#8217;m expecting another any minute. Good Lord!&#8221; he cried
as a group of men turned in at the door. &#8220;Here come some of my passengers
now. Come along, let&#8217;s get out of this!&#8221;</p>

<p>He dragged us out a back door into a very muddy back alley, whence we
floundered to dry land with some difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a narrow escape!&#8221; he cried, wiping his brow.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s go get a drink. I know the best place.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led us to a very ornate saloon whose chief attraction was the fact that
its ceiling was supported on glass pillars! We duly admired this marvel; and
then wandered over to the polished mahogany bar, where we were joined by the
half dozen loafers who had been lounging around the place. These men did not
exactly join us, but they stood expectantly near. Nor were they
disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, let&#8217;s all take a drink, boys!&#8221; cried the captain
heartily.</p>

<p>They named and tossed off their liquor, and then without a word of farewell
or thanks shambled back to their roosting places.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Billy?&#8221; demanded the captain, looking
about curiously. &#8220;Where&#8217;s your usual crowd?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all down at the Verandah,&#8221; replied the barkeeper,
passing a cloth over the satiny wood of the bar. &#8220;Dorgan&#8217;s got a
girl tending bar. Pays her some ungodly <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_399'></a>399</span> wages; and he&#8217;s getting all the crowd.
He&#8217;d better make the most of it while it lasts. She won&#8217;t stay a
week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; I asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Married; sure,&#8221; replied the barkeeper briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the glass pillars will always be here; eh, Billy?&#8221; suggested
the captain. &#8220;Nevertheless I believe we&#8217;ll just wander down and look
her over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Billy indifferently; &#8220;that&#8217;s where all
the rest are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Verandah, situated on the Plaza, was crowded to the doors. Behind the bar
slaved a half dozen busy drink-mixers. The girl, and a very pretty girl she was,
passed the drinks over the counter, and took in the dust.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s straight,&#8221; observed the captain sagaciously, after
inspection; &#8220;if she wasn&#8217;t there wouldn&#8217;t be such a gang. The
other sort is plenty enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did not try to get near the bar, but after a few moments regained the
street. The captain said farewell; and we hunted up, by his direction, the New
York Tonsorial Emporium. There we had five dollars&#8217; worth of various
things done to us; after which we bought new clothes. The old ones we threw out
into the street along with a vast collection of others contributed by our
predecessors.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;I feel like a new man. And before we
go any farther I have a little duty to perform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another drink at the sign of the Glass Pillars, or whatever they call
the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want anything more to drink just now,&#8221; I
protested.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400'></a>400</span>&#8220;Oblige me
in this one treat,&#8221; said Johnny in his best manner.</p>

<p>We entered the Arcade, as the bar was called. At once the loafers moved
forward. Johnny turned to them with an engaging air of friendliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, boys, let&#8217;s all take a drink!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>The glasses were poured. Johnny raised his. The others followed suit. Then
all drained them simultaneously and set down the empty glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; went on Johnny in the same cheerful, friendly tone,
&#8220;let&#8217;s all pay for them!&#8221;</p>

<p>The loafers stared at him a moment. One growled menacingly, but fell silent
under his clear glance. One or two others forced a laugh. Under Johnny&#8217;s
compelling eye they all paid. Billy, behind the bar, watched with sardonic
amusement. When Johnny proffered his dust, the barkeeper thrust it back.</p>

<p>&#8220;My treat here,&#8221; said he briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#x2500;?&#8221; objected Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a privilege.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you put it that way, I thank you, sir,&#8221; said Johnny in his
grandest manner; and we walked out. &#8220;Those bums made me tired,&#8221; was
his only comment to us. &#8220;Now let&#8217;s go hunt up Talbot. I&#8217;ll bet
my extinct toothbrush that he&#8217;s a well-known citizen around
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s extinct toothbrush was perfectly safe. The first man of whom
we inquired told us where our friend lived, and added the gratuitous information
that the Ward Block was nearing completion. We looked up the hotel, a new one on
Montgomery Street. The clerk spoke <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_401'></a>401</span> with respect of Talbot, and told us we would
probably find him at one of the several places of business he mentioned, or at
the Ward Block. We thanked him, and went direct to the Ward Block first. All of
us confessed to a great desire to see that building.</p>

<p>It was to be a three-story brick structure, and was situated at one corner of
the Plaza. We gazed upon it with appropriate awe, for we were accustomed to logs
and canvas; and to some extent we were able to realize what imported bricks and
the laying of them meant. The foreman told us that Talbot had gone out
&#8220;Mission way&#8221; with Sam Brannan and some others to look at some
property, and would not be back until late.</p>

<p>Johnny and I spent the rest of the afternoon wandering about. Yank retired to
the soft chairs of one of the numerous gambling places. His broken leg would not
stand so much tramping.</p>

<p>We had lots of fun, and many interesting minor adventures and encounters,
none of which has any particular bearing here. The town had spread. Most of the
houses were of the flimsied description. Many people were still living in tents.
The latter flopped and tugged in the strong wind. Some men had merely little cot
tents, just big enough to cover the bed. An owner of one of these claimed
stoutly that they were better than big tents.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t get blowed away by the wind, and they&#8217;re fine
to sleep under,&#8221; he asserted, &#8220;and a man cooks outside,
anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about when it rains?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I go down to the Verandah or the Arcade or <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_402'></a>402</span> Dennison&#8217;s Exchange and stay
there till she quits,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>In the evening, as Talbot had not yet returned, we wandered from one place of
amusement to another. The gambling places were more numerous, more elaborate,
more important than ever. Beside the usual rough-looking miners and labourers,
who were in the great majority, there were small groups of substantial, grave,
important looking men conferring. I noticed again the contrast with the
mining-camp gambling halls in the matter of noise; here nothing was heard but
the clink of coin or the dull thud of gold dust, a low murmur of conversation,
or an occasional full-voiced exclamation.</p>

<p>Johnny, who could never resist the tables, was soon laying very small stakes
on <i>monte</i>. After a time I tired of the close air and heavy smoke, and
slipped away. The lower part of the town was impossible on account of the mud,
so I made my way out along the edge of the hills. The moon was sailing overhead.
The shadows of the hills hung deep in the hollows; and, abroad, a wide landscape
slept in the unearthly radiance. A thousand thousand cheerful frogs piped up a
chorus against the brooding moon-stillness they could not quite break. After the
glare of the Arcade and the feverish hum and bustle of the busy new city, this
still peace was almost overpowering. I felt, somehow, that I dared not give way
to it all at once, but must admit its influence trickle by trickle until my
spirit had become a little accustomed. Thus gradually I dropped into a reverie.
The toil, excitement, strain, striving of the past eight or nine months fell
swiftly into <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403'></a>403</span> the
background. I relaxed; and in the calm of the relaxation for the first time old
memories found room.</p>

<p>How long I had tramped, lost in this dreaming, I did not know; but at some
point I must have turned back, for I came to somewhere near the end of
Sacramento Street&#8211;if it could be said to have an end&#8211;to find the
moon far up toward the zenith. A man overtook me, walking rapidly; I caught the
gleam of a watch chain, and on a sudden impulse I turned toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you tell me what time it is?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>The man extended his watch in the moonlight, and silently pointed to its
face&#8211;with the muzzle of a revolver!</p>

<p>&#8220;Half-past twelve,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; I cried with a shout of laughter. &#8220;Do you take
me for a robber, Talbot?&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404'></a>404</span><a id='link_43'></a>CHAPTER XLIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GOLDEN WEB</span></h2>

<p>He thrust away his watch and the pistol and with a shout of joy seized both
my hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! well! well! well!&#8221; he cried over and over again.
&#8220;But I <i>am</i> glad to see you! I&#8217;d no idea where you were or what
you were doing! Why couldn&#8217;t you write a man occasionally?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said I, rather blankly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe it ever occurred to us we <i>could</i> write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the others? Are they with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll look them up,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>Together we walked away, arm in arm. Talbot had not changed, except that he
had discarded his miner&#8217;s rig, and was now dressed in a rather quiet cloth
suit, a small soft hat, and a blue flannel shirt. The trousers he had tucked
into the tops of his boots. I thought the loose, neat costume very becoming to
him. After a dozen swift inquiries as to our welfare, he plunged headlong into
enthusiasms as to the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the greatest city in the world!&#8221; he cried; then
catching my expression, he added, &#8220;or it&#8217;s going to be. Think of it,
Frank! A year ago it had less than a thousand people, and now we have at least
forty thousand. The new Commercial Wharf is nearly half a mile long and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405'></a>405</span> cost us a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars, but we raised the money in ten minutes! We&#8217;re
going to build two more. And Sam Brannan and a lot of us are talking of putting
down plank roads. Think what that will mean! And there&#8217;s no limit to what
we can do in real estate! Just knock down a few of these hills to the
north&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped, for I was laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not drain the bay?&#8221; I suggested. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
plenty of land down there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Talbot in a calmer manner, &#8220;we won&#8217;t
quite do that. But we&#8217;ll put some of those sand hills into the edge of the
bay. You wait and see. If you want to make money, you just buy some of those
waterfront lots. You&#8217;ll wake up some morning to find you&#8217;re a mile
inland.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed again; but just the other day, in this year 1899, I rode in a
street car where fifty years ago great ships had lain at anchor.</p>

<p>We discovered Johnny and Yank, and pounded each other&#8217;s backs, and had
drinks, and generally worked off our high spirits. Then we adjourned to a
corner, lit cigars&#8211;a tremendous luxury for us miners&#8211;and plunged
into recital. Talbot listened to us attentively, his eyes bright with interest,
occasionally breaking in on the narrator to ask one of the others to supplement
some too modestly worded statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; he sighed when we had finished. &#8220;You boys have
certainly had a time! What an experience! You&#8217;ll never forget it!&#8221;
He brooded a while. &#8220;I suppose the world will never see its like again. It
was the chance of a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_406'></a>406</span> lifetime. I&#8217;d like&#8211;no I wouldn&#8217;t!
I&#8217;ve lived, too. Well, now for the partnership. As I understand it, for
the Hangman&#8217;s Gulch end of it, we have, all told, about five thousand
dollars&#8211;at any rate, that was the amount McClellan sent down to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Porcupine Flat venture was a bad loss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The robbers cleaned us out there except for what we sent you,&#8221; I
agreed regretfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since which time Yank has been out of it completely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t made a cent since,&#8221; acknowledged Yank cheerfully,
&#8220;and I owe something to Frank, here, for my keep. Thought I had about
fifteen hundred dollars, but I guess I ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Italian Bar,&#8221; went on Talbot, &#8220;how much did you
make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter what I made,&#8221; interposed Johnny,
&#8220;for, as Frank told you, it&#8217;s all at the bottom of the Sacramento
River.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did pretty well,&#8221; said I, and pulled out two hundred and
sixteen ounces.</p>

<p>&#8220;About three thousand dollars,&#8221; computed Talbot.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the plutocrat, all right. Well, I&#8217;ve done pretty well
with this end of the partnership, too. I think&#8211;but I guess we&#8217;d
better take a fresh day to it. It must be ungodly late. Good Lord, yes! Three
o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody would have thought so. The place seemed nearly as full as ever. We
accompanied Talbot to his hotel, where he managed, after some difficulty, to
procure us a cot apiece.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407'></a>407</span>Our sleep was
short; and in spite of our youth and the vitality we had stored in the healthy
life of the hills we felt dragged out and tired. Five hours&#8217; sleep in two
days is not enough. I was up a few minutes before the rest; and I sat in front
of the hotel basking in the sun like a lizard. The let-down from the toil and
excitement of the past months still held me. I thought with lazy satisfaction of
the two thousand-odd dollars which was my share of our partnership. It was a
small sum, to be sure; but, then, I had never in my life made more than twelve
dollars a week, and this had cost me nothing. Now that definitely I had dropped
overboard my hopes of a big strike, I unexpectedly found that I had dropped with
them a certain feeling of pride and responsibility as well. As long as I had
been in the mining business I had vaguely felt it incumbent on me to do as well
as the rest, were that physically possible. I was out of the mining business. As
I now looked at it, I had been mighty well paid for an exciting and interesting
vacation. I would go back to New York at a cost of two or three hundred dollars,
and find some good opening for my capital and ability.</p>

<p>Talbot appeared last, fresh and smiling. Breakfast finished, he took us all
with him to the new brick building. After some business we adjourned once more
to the Arcade. There Talbot made his report.</p>

<p>I wish I could remember it, and repeat it to you verbatim. It was worth it.
But I cannot; and the most I can do is to try to convey to you the sense of that
scene&#8211;we three tanned, weather-beaten outlanders listening open-mouthed to
the keen, competent, self-assured magician <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_408'></a>408</span> who before our eyes spun his glittering fabric.
Talbot Ward had seized upon the varied possibilities of the new city. The
earnings on his first scheme&#8211;the ship storehouses, and the rental of the
brick building on Montgomery Street, you will remember&#8211;amounted net, the
first month, I believe, to some six thousand dollars. With his share of this
money he had laid narrow margins on a dozen options. Day by day, week by week,
his operations extended. He was in wharves, sand lots, shore lots, lightering,
plank roads, a new hotel. Day after day, week after week, he had turned these
things over, and at each turn money had dropped out. Sometimes the plaything
proved empty, and then Talbot had promptly thrown it away, apparently without
afterthought or regret. I remember some of the details of one deal:</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked to me,&#8221; said Talbot, &#8220;that somebody ought to
make a good thing in flour, the way things were going. It all comes from South
America just now, so enough capital ought to be able to control the supply. I
got together four of the big men here and we agreed with the agents to take not
less than a hundred and fifty thousand barrels nor more than two hundred
thousand barrels at fourteen dollars. Each firm agreed to take seven hundred
thousand dollars&#8217; worth; and each agreed to forfeit one hundred thousand
dollars for failure to comply. Flour could be held to twenty-five to thirty
dollars a barrel; so there was a good thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; I agreed. &#8220;Where did you come
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Percentage of the profits. They took and sold quite a heap of flour at
this rate&#8211;sixty thousand barrels to be <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_409'></a>409</span> exact&#8211;on which there was a net profit of
seven hundred thousand dollars. Then one of those freak things happened that
knocked us all silly. Flour just dropped down out of sight. Why? Manipulation.
They&#8217;ve got a smart lot out here. The mines had flour enough for the time
being; and the only thing that held the price up was the uncertainty of just
where the flour was coming from in the future. Well, the other crowd satisfied
that uncertainty, and our flour dropped from about twenty-five dollars down to
eight. We had sold sixty thousand barrels, and we had ninety thousand to take on
our contract, on each one of which we were due to lose six dollars. And the
other fellows were sitting back chuckling and waiting for us to unload cheap
flour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was there to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Talbot laughed. &#8220;I told our crowd that I had always been taught that
when a thing was hot, to drop it before I got burned. If each firm paid its
forfeit it would cost us four hundred thousand dollars. If we sold all the flour
contracted for at the present price, we stood to lose nearer six hundred
thousand. So we simply paid our forfeits, threw over the contract, and were
three hundred thousand ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But was that fair to the flour people?&#8221; I asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fair?&#8221; retorted Talbot. &#8220;What in thunder did they put the
forfeit clause in for if it wasn&#8217;t expected we might use it?&#8221;</p>

<p>As fast as he acquired a dollar, he invested it in a new chance, until his
interests extended from the Presidio <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_410'></a>410</span> to the waterfront of the inner bay. These interests
were strange odds and ends. He and a man with his own given name, Talbot H.
Green, had title in much of what is now Harbour View&#8211;that is to say, they
would have clear title as soon as they had paid heavy mortgages. His shares in
the Commercial Wharf lay in the safes of a banking house, and the dollars he had
raised on them were valiantly doing duty in holding at bay a pressing debt on
precariously held waterfront equities. Talbot mentioned glibly sums that reduced
even the most successful mining to a child&#8217;s game. The richest strike we
had heard rumoured never yielded the half of what our friend had tossed into a
single deal. Our own pitiful thousands were beggarly by comparison,
insignificant, not worth considering.</p>

<p>Of all the varied and far-extending affairs the Ward Block was the flower.
Talbot owned options, equities, properties, shares in all the varied and
numerous activities of the new city; but each and every one of them he held
subject to payments which at the present time he could by no possibility make.
Mortgages and loans had sucked every immediately productive dollar; and those
dollars that remained were locked tight away from their owner until such time as
he might gain possession of a golden key. This did not worry him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are properties that are bound to rise in value,&#8221; he told
us. &#8220;In fact, they are going up every minute we sit here talking. They are
futures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among other pieces, Talbot had been able to buy the lot on the Plaza where
now the Ward Block was going up. He paid a percentage down, and gave a mortgage
for the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411'></a>411</span> rest. Now
all the money he could squeeze from all his other interests he was putting into
the structure. That is why I rather fancifully alluded to the Ward Block as the
flower of all Talbot&#8217;s activities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Building is the one thing you have to pay cash for throughout,&#8221;
said Talbot regretfully. &#8220;Labour and materials demand gold. But I see my
way clear; and a first-class, well-appointed business block in this town right
now is worth more than the United States mint. That&#8217;s cash coming in for
you&#8211;regularly every month. It will pay from the start four or five times
the amount necessary to keep everything else afloat. Jim Reckett has taken the
entire lower floor at thirty thousand. The offices upstairs will pay from a
thousand a month up and they are every one rented in advance. Once we get our
rents coming in, the strain is relieved. I can begin to take up my mortgages and
loans, and once that is begun we are on the road to Millionaireville.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he recapitulated his affairs&#8211;the land on the Plaza two
hundred thousand; the building eighty thousand; the Harbour View lands anything
they might rise to, but nearly a quarter million now; ten thousand par value of
the wharf stock already paying dividends; real estate here and there and
everywhere in the path of the city&#8217;s growth; shares in a new hotel that
must soon touch par; the plank road&#8211;as we jotted down the figures, and the
magic total grew, such trifling little affairs as gold mines dropped quite below
the horizon. We stared at Talbot fascinated.</p>

<p>And then for the first time we learned that the five <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_412'></a>412</span> thousand dollars we had sent down from
Hangman&#8217;s Gulch, and the sum left from the robbery, was not slumbering in
some banker&#8217;s safe, but had been sent dancing with the other dollars at
Talbot&#8217;s command.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know just what you fellows intended,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;but we were partners up there at the mines, and I concluded it would be
all right. You didn&#8217;t mean&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure not!&#8221; broke in Johnny heartily. &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome
to mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; agreed Yank and I.</p>

<p>And then Talbot let us see that he considered us to that extent partners in
the business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the date it arrived,&#8221; he told us, &#8220;and I know just
how much actual capital I had myself at that time. So I&#8217;m computing your
shares in the venture on that basis. It comes to about one tenth apiece for Yank
and Johnny. Frank and I have an agreement already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny stared at the paper on which the totals had been pencilled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any!&#8221; he protested vehemently. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair!
You&#8217;ve made this thing by sheer genius, and it isn&#8217;t fair for me to
take a tenth of it on the strength of a measly little consignment of gold dust.
You give me your note for a thousand dollars&#8211;or whatever the sum
is&#8211;at interest, if you want to, and that&#8217;s all that is coming to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel the same,&#8221; said Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; argued Talbot earnestly, &#8220;that doesn&#8217;t go.
That five thousand saved me. It came at a time when I had to have money or go
down. I had been to every bank, to every firm, to every man in town, and I
couldn&#8217;t <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413'></a>413</span>
raise ten cents more. If you refuse this thing, you will be doing something
that&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hush up, Tal!&#8221; broke in Johnny gruffly; &#8220;if
that&#8217;s how you feel&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is now,&#8221; said Johnny firmly, &#8220;10:30 A.M., but I&#8217;m
going to have bubbles. If you fellows don&#8217;t want me all drunk and dressed
up, you&#8217;ve got to help me drink them.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414'></a>414</span><a id='link_44'></a>CHAPTER XLIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>PLUTOCRATS!</span></h2>

<p>We felt very elated&#8211;and rather small. Talbot had alone and without, so
to speak, moving from his tracks, made a fortune, while we, after going through
many hardships, adventures, and hard work, had returned almost penniless. One of
our first tasks was to convince Talbot of the injustice to himself in giving us
shares based on a proportionate money investment. We made him see, after a
while, that his own genius counted for something in the matter. He then agreed,
but reluctantly, to reduce our shares to a twentieth each, and included me in
this, despite our previous agreement. If we had adhered to that, my proportion
would have been nearer a fortieth.</p>

<p>This having been decided&#8211;after considerable argument&#8211;we settled
down to wait for the completion of the Ward Block. Once the rents from that
structure should begin to come in, it was agreed we should take out ready money
enough to return East. The remainder, less Talbot&#8217;s expenses, would of
course have to go back into releasing all the other interests. The formal
opening had been arranged for the first of January.</p>

<p>In the meantime we loafed magnificently, and lived on my money. Now that our
futures were all assured, Yank and Johnny condescended to temporary loans.
Occasionally <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415'></a>415</span> we
could help Talbot in some of the details of his varied businesses, but most of
the time we idled. I do think we deserved a rest.</p>

<p>Our favourite occupation was that of reviewing our property. To this end we
took long tramps over the hills, hunting painstakingly for obscure corner stakes
or monuments that marked some one of our numerous lots. On them we would gaze
solemnly, although in no manner did they differ from all the other sage-brush
hill country about them. In a week we knew accurately every piece of property
belonging to Our Interests, and we had listed every other more intangible equity
or asset. One of Johnny&#8217;s favourite feats was to march Yank and me up to a
bar, face us, and interrogate us according to an invariable formula. We must
have presented a comical sight&#8211;I with my great bulk and round, fresh face
alongside the solemn, lank, and leathery Yank; both of us drawn up at attention,
and solemn as prairie dogs.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much is one twentieth of two thousand thousand?&#8221; inquired
Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;One hundred thousand,&#8221; Yank and I chorused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a plutocrat?&#8221; demanded Johnny cryptically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; we cried.</p>

<p>Our sense of our own financial importance being thus refreshed, we advanced
in rigid military formation to the bar and took our drinks. Two million dollars
was the amount we had chosen as representing the value of Our Interests. In
deciding upon this figure we considered ourselves very moderate in refusing to
add probable future increment. It might also be added that we equally <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416'></a>416</span> neglected to deduct
present liabilities. Nobody ever guessed what this mysterious performance of
ours meant, but every one came to expect it and to be amused by it. In a mild
way we and our fool monkeyshines came to be a well-known institution.</p>

<p>Having nothing else to do, we entered heartily into the life and pleasures of
the place, and we met many of the leading citizens. Some of them have since
become historical personages. Talbot was hand in glove with most of them, and in
and out of dozens of their schemes. There was David Broderick, a secretive,
dignified, square-cut, bulldog sort of a man, just making his beginning in a
career that was to go far. I remember he was then principally engaged in
manufacturing gold coins and slugs and buying real estate.<a id="FNanchor_a"></a><a href="#Footnote_a" class="fnanchor"><sup>[A]</sup></a> His great
political rival, Dr. Gwin the Southerner, I also met; and Talbot H. Green, then
and for some time later, one of the most liked and respected of men, but whose
private scandal followed him from the East and ruined him; and Sam Brannan, of
course, the ex-elder of the Mormons; and Jim Reckett, the gambler; and W. T.
Coleman, later known as Old Vigilante, and a hundred others. These were strong,
forceful men, and their company was always interesting. They had ideas on all
current topics, and they did not hesitate to express those ideas. We thus
learned something of the community in which we had been living so long.</p>

<p>We heard of the political difficulties attendant on the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_417'></a>417</span> jumble of military and unauthorized
civil rule; of the convention at Monterey in September, with its bitterly
contested boundary disputes; of the great and mooted question as to whether
California should be &#8220;slave&#8221; or &#8220;free&#8221;; of the doubt and
uncertainty as to the status of California-made law pending some action by the
Federal Congress; of how the Federal Congress, with masterly inactivity and
probably some slight skittishness as to mingling in the slavery argument, had
adjourned without doing anything at all! So California had to take her choice of
remaining under military governorship or going ahead and taking a chance on
having her acts ratified later. She chose the latter course. San José was
selected as the capital. Nobody wanted to serve in the new legislature; men
hadn&#8217;t time. There was the greatest difficulty in getting assemblymen. The
result was that, with few exceptions, the first legislature of fifty-two members
was composed of cheap professional politicians from the South, and useless
citizens from elsewhere. This body was then in session. It was invariably
referred to as &#8220;The Legislature of the Thousand Drinks.&#8221; I heard
discussed numberless schemes for its control for this or that purpose; many of
them, it seemed to me, rather unscrupulous.</p>

<p>These big men of the city talked of other things besides politics. From them
I heard of the state of commercial affairs, with its system of consignments and
auctions, its rumours of fleet clipper ships, its corners of the market, its
gluttings with unforeseen cargoes of unexpected vessels, and all the other
complex and delicate adjustments and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_418'></a>418</span> changes that made business so fascinating and so
uncertain. All these men were filled with a great optimism and an abiding
enthusiasm for the future. They talked of plank roads, of sewers, of schools,
churches, hospitals, pavements, fills, the razing of hills, wharves, public
buildings, water systems; and they talked of them so soberly and in such
concrete terms of accomplishment that the imagination was tricked into accepting
them as solid facts. Often I have gone forth from listening to one of these
earnest discussions to look about me on that wind-swept, sandblown, flimsy,
dirty, sprawling camp they called a city, with its half dozen
&#8220;magnificent&#8221; brick buildings that any New England village could
duplicate, and have laughed wildly until the tears came, over the absurdity of
it. I was young. I did not know that a city is not bricks but men, is not fact
but the vitality of a living ideal.</p>

<p>There were, of course, many other men than those I have named, and of varied
temperaments and beliefs. Some of them were heard of later in the history of the
state. Terry, James King of William, Stephen J. Field, General Richardson were
some of those whose names I remember. They were, in general, frank and open in
manner, ready to offer or take a joke, and on terms of good-natured comradeship
with each other; and yet somehow I always felt behind it all a watchful
reservation. This was indefinable, but it indubitably existed. The effect on me
was an instinct that these men would remain good-natured, laughing, joking,
intimate, just as long as nothing happened to make them otherwise. They were a
pack, hunting in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419'></a>419</span>
full cry the same quarry; but were one of them to fall out, the rest would sweep
on without a backward glance. As an individual human being no one of them was in
reality important to any other. They pursued the same aims, by much the same
methods, and they could sometimes make use of each other to the advantage of
both. In the meantime, since they as the prominent men of a mixed community must
possess qualities in common, they found each other mutually agreeable. Many
called themselves friends; but I much doubt if the friendship that would render
aid at a sacrifice was very common. Every man played his own game.</p>

<p>In the town outside we made many other acquaintances, of all classes of
society. In 1849 no social stigma, or very little, attached to any open
association. Gamblers were respectable citizens, provided they ran straight
games. The fair and frail sisterhood was well represented. It was nothing
against a man, either in the public eye or actually, to be seen talking,
walking, or riding with one of these ladies; for every one knew them. There were
now a good many decent women in town, living mainly with their husbands and
children very quietly among the sandhills on the edges of the town. One saw
little of them unless he took the trouble to search them out. We did so, and
thus struck up acquaintance with a half dozen very pleasant households, where
occasionally my New England heart was gladdened by a genuine homebaked New
England pie. These people had children and religious beliefs; and for the one
and the other they had organized churches and schools, both of which were well
attended. Furthermore, such <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_420'></a>420</span> institutions were contributed to by many of the
business men who never entered their doors. This respectable life was stronger
than is generally known. It was quiet and in the background, and under the deep
shadow cast by the glaring light of downtown, but it was growing in solidity and
strength.</p>

<p>Among the others we came across the preacher we had seen holding forth on the
wharf. He was engaged, with the assistance of two men of the Methodist
persuasion, in building a church. The three had themselves cut and hewed the
timbers. Mr. Taylor, for that was his name, explained to me that, having no
money, that seemed the the only way to get a church. He showed us his own place,
a little shack not unlike the others, but enclosed, and planted with red
geraniums, nasturtiums and other bright things.</p>

<p>&#8220;As far as I know,&#8221; he told us with pride, &#8220;that is the
first garden in San Francisco.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the backyard he had enclosed three chickens&#8211;two hens and a cock.</p>

<p>&#8220;I paid eighteen dollars for them,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>We looked at each other in startled astonishment. The sum appeared a trifle
extravagant considering the just-acknowledged impecuniosity of the church. He
caught the glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he said quaintly, &#8220;San Francisco is a very lonesome
place for the godly. The hosts of sin are very strong, and the faithful are very
few. Mortal flesh is weak; and mortal spirit is prone to black discouragement.
When I bought those chickens I bought eighteen dollars&#8217; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421'></a>421</span> worth of hope. Somehow
Sunday morning seems more like the Sabbath with them clicking around sleepy and
lazy and full of sun.&#8221;</p>

<p>We liked him so much that we turned to at odd times and helped him with his
carpenter work. While thus engaged he confided to us his intention to preach
against the gambling the next Sunday in the Plaza. We stopped hammering to
consider this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t, if I were you,&#8221; said I. &#8220;The gamblers
own the Plaza; they are respected by the bulk of the community; and they
won&#8217;t stand any nonsense. They none of them think anything of shooting a
man in their places. I don&#8217;t think they will stand for it. I am afraid you
will be roughly handled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More likely shot,&#8221; put in Johnny bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, boys, we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; said Taylor easily.</p>

<p>Nor could we move him, in spite of the fact that, as we came to see his
intention was real, we urged very earnestly against it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you will, you will,&#8221; Johnny conceded at last, with a
sigh. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see what we can do to get you a fair show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that is just what I don&#8217;t want you to do,&#8221; begged the
old man earnestly. &#8220;I want no vain contention and strife. If the Lord
desires that I preach to these sinners, He will protect me.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the end he extorted from us a reluctant promise not to mingle in the
affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just <i>looking</i> for trouble,&#8221; muttered Johnny,
&#8220;and there&#8217;s no doubt he&#8217;ll find it. The gamblers aren&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422'></a>422</span> going to stand for
a man&#8217;s cussing &#8217;em outright on their own doorsteps&#8211;and I
don&#8217;t know as I blame them. Gambling isn&#8217;t such a terrible, black,
unforgivable sin as I see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you&#8217;re ahead of the game, Johnny,&#8221;
drawled Yank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same the old fool is wrong,&#8221; persisted Johnny,
&#8220;and he&#8217;s as obstinate as a mule, and he makes me mad clean through.
Nevertheless he&#8217;s a good old sort, and I&#8217;d hate to see him
hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news spread abroad, and there was much speculation as to what would
happen. In general the sentiment was hostile to the preacher. It was considered
an unwarrantable interference with freedom for any man to attempt to dictate the
conduct of another. Everybody agreed that religion was all right; but by
religion they meant some vague utterance of platitudes. On the appointed Sunday
a very large crowd gathered in the Plaza. Nobody knew just what the gamblers
intended to do about it. Those competent citizens were as close mouthed as ever.
But it was understood that no nonsense was to be permitted, and that this
annoying question must be settled at once and fully. As one man expressed
it:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have these fellows caterwauling all over the place if we
don&#8217;t shut down on them right sharp off quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taylor arrived about ten o&#8217;clock and proceeded briskly to the pork
barrel that had been rolled out to serve as a pulpit. He faced a lowering,
hostile mob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said he, &#8220;if some means of communication
existed by which the United States could this morning <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_423'></a>423</span> know that street preaching was to be
attempted in the streets of San Francisco, the morning papers, badly informed as
to the temper and disposition of the people of this new country, would feel
themselves fully justified in predicting riot, if not actual bloodshed.
Furthermore, I do not doubt that the greater dailies would hold their forms open
to report the tragedy when news of it should come in. But we of the West know
better than that. We know ourselves rough and ready, but we know ourselves also
to be lovers of fair play. We know that, even though we may not agree with a
man, we are willing to afford him a fair hearing. And as for rioting or
bloodshed, we can afford to smile rather than become angry at such wide
misconception of our decency and sense of fair dealing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having in this skilful fashion drawn the venom from the fangs of the mob, he
went directly ahead at his sermon, hammering boldly on his major thesis. He
finished in a respectful silence, closed his Bible with a snap, and strode away
through the lane the crowd opened for him.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, there was much in the sermon. Gambling, although considered
one of the respectable amusements, undoubtedly did a great deal of harm. Men
dropped their last cents at the tables. I remember one young business man who
had sold out his share in his firm for ten thousand dollars in cash and three
notes for five thousand each. He had every intention of taking this little
fortune back to his family in the East, but he began gambling. First, he lost
his ten thousand dollars in cash. This took him just two days. After vacillating
another day, he staked one of the notes, at a discount, of course. This he lost.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424'></a>424</span> A second note
followed the first; and everybody confidently expected that the third would
disappear in the same fashion. But Jim Reckett, who was a very good sort, took
this man aside, and gave him a good talking-to.</p>

<p>&#8220;You confounded fool,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;re barred from
my tables. My advice to you is to go to your old partners, tell them what an ass
you&#8217;ve made of yourself, and ask them to let you have a few thousand on
that last note. And then you leave on to-day&#8217;s Panama steamer. And, say,
if they won&#8217;t do it, you come to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young fellow took this advice.</p>

<p>The Panama steamers were crowded to the rail. Indeed, the exodus was almost
as brisk as the immigration, just at this time of year. A moderate proportion of
those going out had been successful, but the great majority were disappointed.
They were tired, and discouraged, and homesick; and their minds were obsessed
with the one idea&#8211;to get back. We who remained saw them go with
considerable envy, and perhaps a good deal of inner satisfaction that soon we
were to follow. Of the thousands who were remaining in California, those who had
definitely and permanently cast their lot with the country were lost in the
crowd. The rest intended to stay another year, two years, perhaps even three;
but then each expected to go back.</p>

<p>Broderick actually manufactured coins with face value of $5 and $10 containing but $4
and $8 worth of gold. The inscription on them was simply that of the date, the location,
and the value. They passed everywhere because they were more convenient than dust,
and it was realized that only the last holders could lose.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_425'></a>425</span><a id='link_45'></a>CHAPTER XLV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CATASTROPHE</span></h2>

<p>So things went along for a month. Christmas drew near. Every joint in town
was preparing for a big celebration, and we were fully in the mood to take part
in it. The Ward Block was finished. From top to bottom it had been swept and
cleared. Crowds came every day to admire the varnish, the glass, the fireplaces,
the high plastered walls; to sniff the clean new smell of it. Everybody admitted
it to be the finest building in the city. Yank, Johnny, and I spent most of our
time proudly showing people around, pointing out the offices the various firms
intended to occupy. Downstairs Jim Reckett was already installing some of the
splendours that were to make the transplanted El Dorado the most gorgeous
gambling place in town. Here the public was not admitted. The grand opening, on
New Year&#8217;s day, was not thus to lose its finest savour.</p>

<p>On Christmas eve we went to bed, strangely enough, very early. All the rest
of the town was celebrating, but we had been busy moving furniture and fixtures,
had worked late in order to finish the job, and were very tired. By this time we
were so hardened that we could sleep through any sort of a racket, so the row
going on below and on both sides did not bother us a bit. I, personally, fell
immediately into a deep slumber.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426'></a>426</span>The first
intimation of trouble came to me in my sleep. I dreamed we were back on the
Porcupine, and that the stream was in flood. I could distinctly hear the roar of
it, as it swept by; and I remember Johnny and myself were trying desperately to
climb a big pine tree in order to get above the encroaching waters. A wind
sprang up and shook the pine violently. I came slowly to waking consciousness,
the dream fading into reality. Yank was standing by my cot, shaking me by the
shoulder. He was fully dressed, and carried his long rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up!&#8221; he told me. &#8220;There&#8217;s a big fire one or two
doors away, and it&#8217;s headed this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I realized that the roar of the flames had induced my dream.</p>

<p>I hastily slipped on my clothes and buckled my gold belt around my waist. The
fire was humming away in a steady crescendo, punctuated by confused shouts of
many men. Light flickered redly through the cracks of the loosely constructed
hotel building. I found Johnny awaiting me at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hummer,&#8221; he said; &#8220;started in Denison&#8217;s
Exchange. They say three men have been killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Plaza was black with men, their faces red with the light of the flames. A
volunteer crew were busily darting in and out of the adjacent buildings,
carrying out all sorts of articles and dumping them in the square.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no water nearer than the bay,&#8221; an acquaintance
shouted in our ears. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t much to do. She&#8217;ll burn
herself out in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three buildings were already gutted. A sheet <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_427'></a>427</span> of fire sucked straight upward in the
still air, as steadily as a candle flame, and almost as unwavering. It was a
grand and beautiful spectacle. The flimsy structures went like paper. Talbot saw
us standing at a little elevation, and forced his way to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will die down in five minutes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What do you
bet on Warren&#8217;s place? Do you think she&#8217;ll go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty hot all around there,&#8221; said I doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but the flames are going straight up; and, as you say, it will
begin to die down pretty soon,&#8221; put in Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;The walls are smoking a little,&#8221; commented a bystander
judicially.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a fine old bonfire, anyway,&#8221; said Talbot.</p>

<p>Fifteen or twenty men were trying to help Warren&#8217;s place resist the
heat. They had blankets and pails of water, and were attempting to interpose
these feeble defences at the points most severely attacked. Each man stood it as
long as he could, then rushed out to cool his reddened face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reminds me of the way I used to pop corn when I was a kid,&#8221;
grinned a miner. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t care for that job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same, they&#8217;ll save it,&#8221; observed Talbot
judicially.</p>

<p>Almost coincident with his words a long-drawn <i>a-ah</i>! burst from the
crowd. A wandering gust of wind came in from the ocean. For the briefest instant
the tall straight column of flame bent gracefully before it, then came upright
again as it passed. In that instant it licked across the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_428'></a>428</span> side wall of Warren&#8217;s place, and
immediately Warren&#8217;s place burst into flame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard luck!&#8221; commented Talbot.</p>

<p>The firefighters swarmed out like bees from a disturbed hive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our hotel next,&#8221; said Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s safe enough; there&#8217;s a wide lot between,&#8221; I
observed.</p>

<p>A fresh crew of firefighters took the place of the others&#8211;namely, those
personally interested in saving the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky the night is so still,&#8221; said Talbot.</p>

<p>We watched Warren&#8217;s place burn with all the half guilty joy of those
who are sorry; but who are glad to be there if it has to happen. Suddenly Talbot
threw up his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel that breeze?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suction into the fire,&#8221; suggested Johnny.</p>

<p>But Talbot shook his head impatiently, trying to peer through the glare into
the sky.</p>

<p>It was a very gentle breeze from the direction of the ocean. I could barely
feel it on my cheek, and it was not strong enough as yet to affect in the
slightest the upward-roaring column of flame. For a moment I was inclined to
agree with Johnny that it was simply a current of air induced by the
conflagration. But now an uneasy motion began to take place in the crowd. Men
elbowed their way here and there, met, conferred, gathered in knots. In less
than a minute Talbot signalled us. We made our way to where he was standing with
Sam Brannan, Casey, Green, and a few others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429'></a>429</span>&#8220;Thank God
the wind is from the northwest,&#8221; Talbot said fervently. &#8220;The Ward
Block is safely to windward, and we don&#8217;t need to worry about that,
anyway. But it is a wind, and it&#8217;s freshening. We&#8217;ve got to do
something to stop this fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>As though to emphasize the need for some sort of action, a second and
stronger puff of wind sent whirling aloft a shower of sparks and brands.</p>

<p>We started at double quick in the direction of the flimsy small structures
between the old El Dorado and the Parker House. Some men, after a moment,
brought ropes and axes. We began to tear down the shanties.</p>

<p>But before we had been at work five minutes, the fire began to run. The wind
from the sea increased. Blazing pieces of wood flew through the air like arrows.
Flames stooped in their stride, and licked up their prey, and went on rejoicing.
Structures one minute dark and cold and still burst with startling suddenness
and completeness into rioting conflagration. Our little beginning of a defence
was attacked and captured before we had had time to perfect it. The half dozen
shanties we had pulled to the ground merely furnished piled fuel. Somewhat
demoralized, we fell back, and tried, rather vaguely, to draw a second line of
defence. The smoke and sparks suffocated and overwhelmed us, and the following
flames leaped upon us as from behind an ambush. Some few men continued gropingly
to try to do something, but the most of us were only too glad to get out where
we could catch a breath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_430'></a>430</span>Almost
immediately, however, we were hurried back by frantic merchants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Save the goods!&#8221; was the cry.</p>

<p>We laboured like slaves, carrying merchandise, fixtures, furniture, anything
and everything from the darkened interiors of buildings to the open spaces. I
worked as I had never worked before, and not once did I know whose property I
thus saved. At first I groped in the darkness, seizing what I could; then
gradually, like the glow of a red dawn, a strange light grew, showing dimly and
ruddily the half-guessed features of the place. It glowed, this light,
increasing in power as heating metal slowly turns red. And then the flames
licked through; and dripping with sweat, I abandoned that place to its
enemy.</p>

<p>All sense of time and all sense of locality were lost. The world was a
strange world of deep, concealing shadows and strong, revealing glares, and a
mist of smoke, and hurrying, shouting, excited multitudes. Sometimes I found
myself in queer little temporary eddies of stillness, where a certain calm and
leisure seemed to have been insulated. Then for a brief moment or so I rested.
Occasionally I would find myself with some stranger, and we would exchange brief
exclamatory remarks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whole city is going!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear a roof fell in and killed twenty men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably exaggerated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably. Don&#8217;t catch me under no falling roofs! When she gets
afire, I get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431'></a>431</span>&#8220;Well, I
suppose we ought to try to do <i>something</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>And we would go at it again.</p>

<p>At the end of two or three hours&#8211;no man can guess time in such a
situation&#8211;the fire stopped advancing. I suppose the wind must have
changed, though at the time I did not notice it. At any rate, I found myself in
the gray dawn looking rather stupidly at a row of the frailest kind of canvas
and scantling houses which the fire had sheared cleanly in two, and wondering
why in thunder the rest of them hadn&#8217;t burned!</p>

<p>A dense pall of smoke hung over the city, and streamed away to the south and
east. In the burned district all sense of location had been lost. Where before
had been well-known landmarks now lay a flat desert. The fire had burned
fiercely and completely, and, in lack of food, had died down to almost nothing.
A few wisps of smoke still rose, a few coals glowed, but beside them nothing
remained to indicate even the laying out of the former plan. Only over across a
dead acreage of ashes rose here and there the remains of isolated brick walls.
They looked, through the eddying mists and smoke, like ancient ruins, separated
by wide spaces.</p>

<p>I gazed dully across the waste area, taking deep breaths, resting, my mind
numb. Then gradually it was borne in on me that the Plaza itself looked rather
more empty-sided than it should. A cold hand gripped my heart. I began to skirt
the smouldering embers of the shanties and wooden warehouses, trying to follow
where the streets had been. Men were prowling <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_432'></a>432</span> about everywhere, blackened by smoke, their
clothing torn and burned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you make out where Higgins&#8217;s store was?&#8221; one of them
hailed me. &#8220;I had a little shanty next door, and some gold dust. Figure I
might pan it out of the ashes, if I could only find the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had no time to help him, and left him prowling around seeking for a
landmark.</p>

<p>The Plaza was full of people. I made my way to the northerly corner, and,
pushing a passage through the bystanders, contemplated three jagged, tottering
brick walls, a heap of smouldering débris, and a twisted tangle of iron work.
This represented all that remained of the Ward Block. The change of wind that
had saved the shanties had destroyed our fortune!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_433'></a>433</span><a id='link_46'></a>CHAPTER XLVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE VISION</span></h2>

<p>Within ten hours men were at work rebuilding. Within ten days the burned area
was all rebuilt. It took us just about the former period of time to determine
that we would be unable to save anything from the wreck; and about the latter
period for the general public to find it out.</p>

<p>Talbot made desperate efforts for a foothold, and in succession interviewed
all the big men. They were sorry but they were firm. Each had been hard hit by
the fire; each had himself to cover; each was forced by circumstances to grasp
every advantage. Again, they were sorry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are!&#8221; cried Talbot; &#8220;they just reach out and
grab what ought to be my profits! Well, it&#8217;s the game. I&#8217;d do the
same myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>By that night we knew that Talbot had lost every piece of property he
owned&#8211;or thought he owned. The destruction of the Ward Block swept away
every cent of income, with the exception of the dividends from the Wharf Company
stock. These latter could not begin to meet the obligations of interest and
agreed payments on the other property.</p>

<p>The state of affairs became commonly known in about ten days simply because,
in those rapid times, obligations <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_434'></a>434</span> were never made nor money lent for longer periods
than one month. At the end of each thirty days they had to be renewed. Naturally
Talbot could not renew them.</p>

<p>We knew all that long in advance, and we faced the situation with some
humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, boys,&#8221; said Talbot, &#8220;here we are. About a year ago,
as I remember it, our assets were a bundle of newspapers and less than a hundred
dollars. Haven&#8217;t even got a newspaper now, but I reckon among us we could
just about scrape up the hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got nearer twenty-seven hundred in my belt,&#8221; I
pointed out.</p>

<p>An embarrassed silence fell for a moment; then Talbot spoke up, picking his
words very carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve talked that over, Frank,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and
we&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that you must keep that and go home, just as
you planned to do. You&#8217;re the only man of us who has managed to keep what
he has made. Johnny falls overboard and leaves his in the bottom of the
Sacramento; Yank gets himself busted in a road-agent row; I&#8211;I&#8211;well,
I blow soap bubbles! You&#8217;ve kept at it, steady and strong and reliable,
and you deserve your good luck. You shouldn&#8217;t lose the fruits of your
labour because we, each in our manner, have been assorted fools.&#8221;</p>

<p>I listened to this speech with growing indignation; and at its conclusion I
rose up full of what I considered righteous anger. My temper is very slow to
rouse, but when once it wakes, it takes possession of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, you fellows!&#8221; I cried, very red in the <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_435'></a>435</span> face, they tell me.
&#8220;You answer me a few questions. Are we or are we not partners? Are we or
are we not friends? Do you or do you not consider me a low-lived, white-livered,
mangy, good-for-nothing yellow pup? Why, confound your pusillanimous souls, what
do you mean by talking to me in that fashion? For just about two cents I&#8217;d
bust your fool necks for you&#8211;every one of you!&#8221; I glared
vindictively at them. &#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;d make any such proposition
to any of you&#8211;to ask you to sneak off like a whipped cur leaving me to
take the&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Frank,&#8221; interposed Talbot soothingly. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t mean&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; I cried. &#8220;Well, what in hell did you
mean? Weren&#8217;t you trying to make me out a quitter?&#8221; I had succeeded
in working loose my heavy gold belt, and I dashed it on the table in front of
them. &#8220;There! Now you send for some gold scales, right now, and you divide
that up! Right here! Damn it all, boys,&#8221; I ended, with what to a cynical
bystander would have seemed rather a funny slump into the pathetic, &#8220;I
thought we were all real friends! You&#8217;ve hurt my feelings!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was very young, and very ridiculous&#8211;and perhaps (I can say it from
the vantage of fifty years) just a little touching. At any rate, when I had
finished, my comrades were looking in all directions, and Talbot cleared his
throat a number of times before he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Frank,&#8221; he said gently, at last, &#8220;of course
we&#8217;ll take it&#8211;we never dreamed&#8211;of course&#8211;it was stupid
of us, I&#8217;ll admit. Naturally, I see just how you feel&#x2500;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_436'></a>436</span>&#8220;It comes
to about seven hundred apiece, don&#8217;t it?&#8221; drawled Yank.</p>

<p>The commonplace remark saved the situation from bathos, as I am now certain
shrewd old Yank knew it would.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with your shares, boys?&#8221; asked Talbot
after a while. &#8220;Going back home, or mining? Speak up, Yank.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yank spat accurately out the open window.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been figgering,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;And when you come
right down to it, what&#8217;s the use of going back? Ain&#8217;t it just an
idee we got that it&#8217;s the proper thing to do? What&#8217;s the matter with
this country, anyway&#8211;barring mining?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barring mining?&#8221; echoed Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;To hell with mining!&#8221; said Yank; &#8220;it&#8217;s all right for
a vacation, but it ain&#8217;t noways a white man&#8217;s stiddy work. Well, we
had our vacation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re not going back to the mines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any!&#8221; stated Yank emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take up a farm up thar whar the Pine boys is
settled, and I&#8217;m going to enjoy life reasonable. Thar&#8217;s good soil,
and thar&#8217;s water; thar&#8217;s pleasant prospects, and lots of game and
fish. What more does a man want? And what makes me sick is that it&#8217;s been
thar all the time and it&#8217;s only just this minute I&#8217;ve come to see
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mines for you, Johnny, or home?&#8221; asked Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me, home?&#8221; cried Johnny; &#8220;why&#x2500;&#8221; he checked
himself, and added more quietly. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not going <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_437'></a>437</span> home. There&#8217;s
nothing there for me but a good time, when you come right down to it. And mines?
It strikes me that fresh gold is easy to get, but almighty hard to
keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never said a truer word than that, Johnny,&#8221; I put in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides which, I quit mining some time ago, as you remember,&#8221;
went on Johnny, &#8220;due to an artistic aversion to hard work,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any plans?&#8221; asked Talbot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll just drift up to Sonoma and talk things over with
Danny Randall,&#8221; replied Johnny vaguely. &#8220;He had some sort of an idea
of extending this express service next year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; Talbot turned to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; said I, firmly, &#8220;am going to turn over my share in a
business partnership with you; and in the meantime I expect to get a job driving
team with John McGlynn for enough to pay the board bill while you rustle. And
that goes!&#8221; I added warningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Frank,&#8221; replied Talbot, and I thought I saw his
bright eye dim. He held silent for a moment. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he said
suddenly, &#8220;I believe we&#8217;re on the right track. It isn&#8217;t the
gold. That is a bait, a glittering bait, that attracts the world to these
shores. It&#8217;s the country. The gold brings them, and out of the hordes that
come, some, like us, will stick. And after the gold is dug and scattered and all
but forgotten, we will find that we have fallen heirs to an empire.&#8221;</p>
